# Indexing USDT on Tron

:::info
Tron support in SQD is now in public beta. Please report any bugs or suggestions to [Squid Devs](https://t.me/HydraDevs).
:::

In this tutorial we will look into a squid that indexes USDT transfers on the [Tron Network](https://tron.network).

Pre-requisites: Node.js v20 or newer, Git, Docker.

## Download the project

Begin by retrieving the template and installing the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subsquid-labs/tron-example
cd tron-example
npm i
```

## TronBatchProcessor configuration

[Squid processor](/sdk/reference/processors/architecture) is a term with two meanings:

1. The process responsible for retrieving and transforming the data.

2. The main object implementing that process.

On Tron, [`TronBatchProcessor`](/tron-indexing/tron-batch-processor) is the class that should be used for processor objects. Our first step is to create the processor and configure it to fetch USDT transfers data:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
// Note that the address is in lowercase hex and has no leading `0x`.
// This is the format used throughout the SQD Tron stack.
const USDT_ADDRESS = 'a614f803b6fd780986a42c78ec9c7f77e6ded13c'
const TRANSFER_TOPIC = 'ddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef'

const processor = new TronBatchProcessor()
  // The SQD Network gateway URL - this is where the bulk of data will
  // be coming from.
  .setGateway('https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/tron-mainnet')
  // SQD Network is always about N blocks behind the head.
  // We must use regular HTTP API endpoint to get through the last mile
  // and stay on top of the chain.
  // This is a limitation, and we promise to lift it in the future!
  .setHttpApi({
    // Ankr public endpoint is heavily rate-limited so expect many 429 errors
    url: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/http/tron',
    strideConcurrency: 1,
    strideSize: 1,
  })
  // We request data items via `.addXxx()` methods.
  // Each `.addXxx()` method accepts item selection criteria
  // and also allows to request related items.
  .addLog({
    // select logs
    where: {
      address: [USDT_ADDRESS],
      topic0: [TRANSFER_TOPIC]
    },
    // for each log selected above load related transactions
    include: {
      transaction: true
    }
  })
  // For each data item we can specify a set of fields we want to fetch.
  // Accurate selection of only the required fields can have a notable
  // positive impact on performance when data is sourced from SQD Network.
  .setFields({
    block: {
      timestamp: true,
    },
    transaction: {
      hash: true
    },
    log: {
      address: true,
      data: true,
      topics: true
    }
  })
```

The next step is to configure data decoding and transformation.

## Processing the data

The other part of the squid processor configuration is the callback function used to process batches of filtered data, the [batch handler](/sdk/reference/processors/architecture/#processorrun). It is typically defined within a `processor.run()` call, like this:
```typescript
processor.run(database, async ctx => {
  ...
}
```
Here,
* `processor` is the object described in the previous section
* `database` is a [`Database` implementation](/sdk/resources/persisting-data/overview) specific to the target data sink. We want to store the data in a PostgreSQL database and present with a GraphQL API, so we provide a [`TypeormDatabase`](/sdk/resources/persisting-data/typeorm/) object here.
* `ctx` is the [batch context](/sdk/reference/processors/architecture/#batch-context) object that exposes a batch of data (at `ctx.blocks`) and any data persistence facilities derived from `db` (at `ctx.store`). See [Block data for Tron](/tron-indexing/tron-batch-processor/context-interfaces) for details on how the data batches are presented.

Batch handler is where the raw on-chain data is decoded, transformed and persisted. Here is our definition:
```typescript title="src/main.ts"
processor.run(new TypeormDatabase(), async ctx => {
  let transfers: Transfer[] = []

  for (let block of ctx.blocks) {
    for (let log of block.logs) {
      if (log.address == USDT_ADDRESS &&
          log.topics?.[0] === TRANSFER_TOPIC) {
        assert(log.data, 'USDT transfers always carry data')
        let tx = log.getTransaction()
        // `0x` prefixes make log data compatible with EVM codec
        let event = {
          topics: log.topics.map(t => '0x' + t),
          data: '0x' + log.data
        }
        let {from, to, value} = erc20.events.Transfer.decode(event)

        transfers.push(new Transfer({
          id: log.id,
          blockNumber: block.header.height,
          timestamp: new Date(block.header.timestamp),
          tx: tx.hash,
          from,
          to,
          amount: value
        }))
      }
    }
  }

  await ctx.store.insert(transfers)
})
```
This goes through all the logs in the block, verifies that they originate from `USDT_ADDRESS` and have a `TRANSFER_TOPIC` as the first topic, decodes the log and saves a `Transfer` record with the obtained data to the database. See [Prepare the store](/sdk/how-to-start/squid-development/#store) for more details on how the database interface works.

:::info
Notice that we used the SQD EVM codec and [`squid-evm-typegen`](/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/generation/?typegen=evm)-generated module to decode events. Since Tron events are fully EVM-compatible, this is the recommended way.

This tooling requires that the hex values are prefixed with `0x`, as shown above.
:::

At this point the squid is ready for its first test run. Execute
```bash
npx tsc
docker compose up -d
npx squid-typeorm-migration apply
node -r dotenv/config lib/main.js
```
You can verify that the data is being stored in the database by running
```bash
docker exec "$(basename "$(pwd)")-db-1" psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM transfer LIMIT 100"
```
