# Processor Context

`BatchContext` is a generic interface defined as follows: 
```ts
export interface BatchContext<Store, Item> {
    /**
     * access to the chain and the metadata
     * @internal
     */
    _chain: Chain
    log: Logger
    /**
     * Handle for the data sink
     */
    store: Store
    /**
     * Next batch of items to be processed, grouped into blocks
     */
    blocks: BatchBlock<Item>[]
    /**
     * Signals that the processor has reached the chain head.
     *
     * The head block is always included in `.blocks`.
     */
    isHead: boolean
}
```

Note that the `Item` type is inferred from the processor type and configuration. `Store` type is inferred from the `Database` instance passed into the `run()` method.

## `ctx._chain`

Internal handle for direct access to the underlying chain state via RPC calls. Rarely used directly, but rather by the facade access classes generated by the [typegen tools](/glossary/#typegen).

## `ctx.store`

Interface for the target data sink. See [Store Interface](/basics/store).

## `ctx.log` 

The native logger handle. See [logging](/basics/logging).

## `ctx.blocks`

The on-chain data items (event logs and transaction call records) are grouped into blocks and canonically ordered by how the data is recorded on-chain. The shape of item objects is determined by the processor configuration done via the `.addXXX()` methods. 

An idiomatic use of the context API is to iterate first over blocks and then over items for each block:

```ts
processor.run(new TypeormDatabase(), async (ctx) => {
    for (const block of ctx.blocks) {
      for (const item of c.items) {
        //        
      }
    }
});
```
The canonical ordering of `ctx.blocks` enables efficient in-memory data processing. For example, multiple updates of the same entity can be compressed into a single database transaction.

## `ctx.isHead`

Set to `true` if the processor has reached the chain head. The last block `ctx.blocks` is then the current chain tip.
