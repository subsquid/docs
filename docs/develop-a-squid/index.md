# Develop a squid

Below is a general outline of the squid development steps. 

### 0. Prerequisites

- Get familiar with Archives and squids reading with the [Overview](/overview)
- Follow through the [Quickstart](/quickstart) and scaffold a squid project using [sqd init](/squid-cli/init).

### 1. Model the data with a schema file

Start the development by defining the schema of the target database in the `schema.graphql` in the squid root folder. The schema file also defines the shape of the GraphQL API of the squid. The schema definition consists of regular graphql type declarations annotated with custom directives to define:
- relations between the entities
- entity properties, property types and constraints 
- indexes to be created in the database

A full description of the `schema.graphql` dialect is available [here](/develop-a-squid/schema-file).

### 2. Generate TypeORM classes

The squid processor data handlers use [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io) entities
to interact with the target database during the data processing. All necessary entity classes are
generated by the squid framework from `schema.graphql` with 
```bash
npx squid-typeorm-codegen
```

By convention, the generated model classes are kept in `src/model/generated` by default. Custom user-defined entities can
be added in `src/model/index.ts`.

### 3. Generate the database migrations

For this step you need a clean Postgres database running locally:
```bash
# drop the old schema
make down
# start a clean postgres in Docker
make up
```

The database schema changes (including the initial DDL) are applied through migration files located at `db/migrations`. The migrations are generated by 
```bash
# remove the old migrations
rm -rf db/migrations/*.js
# build the sources
npm run build
# generated the new schema migrations in db/migrations
npx squid-typeorm-migration generate
```

Consult [schema updates](/develop-a-squid/schema-file/schema-updates) for more details.

### 4. Define the squid processor and the data handlers

A squid processor is a separate node.js process that fetches historical on-chain data, performs arbitrary transformations and saves the result into the target database schema defined above. By convention, the processor entry point is `src/processor.ts`.

- [`EvmBatchProcessor`](/develop-a-squid/evm-processor) (imported from `@subsquid/evm-processor`) is used for EVM chains.
- [`SubstrateBatchProcessor`](/develop-a-squid/substrate-processor) (imported from `@subsquid/substrate-processor`) is used for Substrate-based chains.



### 5. Initialize a suitable processor instance 
Configure the processor by defining:
- the archive endpoint
- indexing data ranges
- data to be extracted from Archives

**Example:**
```ts
const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    archive: 'https://eth.archive.subsquid.io',
  })
  .addTransaction([
    '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  ], {
    range: {
      from: 6_000_000
    },
    data: {
      transaction: {
        from: true,
        input: true,
        to: true
      }
    }
  });
```

See [EvmBatchProcessor configuration](/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/configuration) and [SubstrateBatchProcessor configuration](/develop-a-squid/substrate-processor/configuration) for details.

### 6. Generate Typescript facade classes to decode the on-chain-data:
- For EVM data, use [`evm-typegen`](/typegen/squid-evm-typegen) 
- For Substrate data, use [`substrate-typegen`](/typegen/squid-evm-typegen)
- For Ink! smart contract data, use [`ink-typegen`](/typegen/squid-wasm-typegen)

### 7. Define the processor batch handler defined by the `processor.run()` method. 
- For `EvmBatchProcessor`, see the [Data Mapping page](/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/data-mapping) 
- For `SubstrateBatchProcessor`, see the [data handlers section](/develop-a-squid/substrate-processor/data-handlers)

### 8. Run the processor with 
```bash
make process
```

For an end-to-end walkthrough, see

- [`EvmBatchProcessor` in action](/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/batch-processor-in-action)
- [`SubstrateBatchProcessor` in action](/develop-a-squid/substrate-processor/batch-processor-in-action)


### 9. Run locally and test the GraphQL endpoint

Follow [Run a Squid](/run-squid) page for details. Reiterate the steps 1, 2, 3 if there's a need to change the data model. 

## What's next?

- Learn from the [Squids examples](/develop-a-squid/examples)
- Get familiar with the [typegen tools](/develop-a-squid/typegen)
