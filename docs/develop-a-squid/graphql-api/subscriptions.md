# Query subscriptions

**Available since `@subsquid/graphql-server@2.0.0`**

:::info
This is an experimental feature. Reach out on [Squid Devs Chat](https://t.me/HydraDevs) for more details.
:::

The OpenReader supports [GraphQL subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/) via live queries. The query is repeatedly executed (every 5 seconds by default) and the clients are responsible for handling the result set updates. 

To enable subscriptions, `squid-graphql-server` must be started with the `--subscriptions` flag. 

For each entity types, the following queries are supported for subscriptions:
- `${EntityName}ById` -- query a single entity
- `${EntityName}s` -- query multiple entities with a `where` filter

**Example** 

The squid-template has a sample [script](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-template/blob/main/scripts/sub-client.js) to demonstrate how to subscribe to the five most recent transfers on Kusama:

```typescript
const client = createClient({
  webSocketImpl: WebSocket,
  url: `ws://localhost:4350/graphql`,
});

client.subscribe(
  {
    query: `
    subscription {
        transfers(limit: 5, orderBy: timestamp_DESC) {
            amount
            blockNumber
            from {
              id
            }
            to {
              id
            }
        }
    }  
    `,
  },
  {
    next: (data) => {
      console.log(`New transfers: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
    },
    error: (error) => {
      console.error('error', error);
    },
    complete: () => {
      console.log('done!');
    },
  }
);
```
