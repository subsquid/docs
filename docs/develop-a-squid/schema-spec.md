# The schema file

The file `schema.graphql` defines the target Postgres database schema and the corresponding TypeORM entity classes generated by [`squid-substrate-typegen(1)`](https://github.com/subsquid/squid/tree/master/substrate-typegen) in `src/model/generated`. The schema is defined with a GraphQL dialect enriched with special directives.  

The schema file also defines the GraphQL API of the [OpenReader](https://github.com/subsquid/squid/tree/master/openreader) server to present the data. This page only describes the database schema part.

## Entities

Entities are defined by root-level GraphQL types decorated with `@entity`. The entity names and the properties are expected to be camelCased and are converted into snake_cased database tables and columns. The primary key column is always mapped to the entity field of a special `ID` type. Non-nullable fields are marked with an exclamation mark (`!`) and are nullable otherwise. 

The following [scalar types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) are supported by the `schema.graphql` dialect:

- `Boolean` (mapped to `bool`)
- `BigInt` (mapped to `numeric`)
- `DateTime` (mapped to `timestamptz`)
- `Bytes` (mapped to `bytea`)
- `JSON` (mapped to `jsonb`)
- `String` (mapped to `text`)
- `Int` (mapped to `int4`)
- Enums (mapped to `text`)
- User-defined scalars (non-entity types). Such properties are mapped as `jsonb` columns.

**Example** 
```graphql
type Scalar @entity {
    id: ID!
    boolean: Boolean
    string: String
    enum: Enum
    bigint: BigInt
    dateTime: DateTime
    bytes: Bytes
    json: JSON,
    deep: DeepScalar
}
        
type DeepScalar {
    bigint: BigInt
    dateTime: DateTime
    bytes: Bytes
    boolean: Boolean
}
        
enum Enum {
    A B C
}
```

## Arrays

Entity fields can be an array of any scalar type and are mapped to the corresponding Postgres array types. The array elements may be defined as nullable or non-nullable.

**Example**

```graphql
type Lists @entity {
    intArray: [Int!]!
    enumArray: [Enum!]
    bigintArray: [BigInt!]
    datetimeArray: [DateTime!]
    bytesArray: [Bytes!]
    listOfListOfInt: [[Int]]
    listOfJsonObjects: [Foo!]
}
        
enum Enum {
    A B C D E F
}
        
type Foo {
    foo: Int
    bar: Int
}
```

## Entity relations and inverse lookups

A relation between two entities is always assumed to be unidirectional. The owning entity is mapped to a database table holding a foreign key reference to the related entity. The non-owning entity may define a property decorated `@derivedFrom` for an inverse lookup on the owning field (but it will have no effect on the table DDL). All the foreign key reference columns are automatically indexed. 

The following examples illustrate this concept.

**One-to-one relation**

```graphql
type Account @entity {
  "Account address"
  id: ID!
  balance: BigInt!
  user: User @derivedFrom(field: "account")
}

type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  account: Account!
  username: String!
  creation: DateTime!
}
```

The `User` entity references a single `Account` and owns the relation (that is, the database schema will define the column `user.account_id` referencing to the `account` table).  

**Many-to-one/One-to-many relations**

```graphl
type Account @entity {
  "Account address"
  id: ID!
  transfersTo: [Transfer!] @derivedFrom(field: "to")
  transfersFrom: [Transfer!] @derivedFrom(field: "from")
}

type Transfer @entity {
  id: ID!
  to: Account!
  from: Account!
  amount: BigInt! 
}

```

Here `Tranfer` defines two foreign key references and `Account` defines the corresponding inverse lookup properties.

**Many-to-many relations**

Many-to-many entity relations should be modelled as two one-to-many relations with an explicitly defined join table. 
Here is an example:

```graphql
# an explicit join table 
type TradeToken @entity {
  id: ID! # This is required, even if useless
  trade: Trade!
  token: Token! 
}

type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
  symbol: String!
  trades: [TradeToken!]! @derivedFrom(field: "token")    
}

type Trade @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokens: [TradeToken!]! @derivedFrom(field: "trade")
}
```

## Indexes

To add an index to a column, the corresponding entity field must be decorated with `@index`. It is crucial to index the entity fields for which one expects filtering and ordering at the API level.

**Example**
```graphql
type Transfer @entity {
  id: ID!
  
  to: Account!
  amount: BigInt! @index
  fee: BigInt! 
}
```

Multi-column indices can be defined on the entity level, with the additional `unique` option. 

**Example**
```graphql
type Foo @entity @index(fields: ["baz", "bar"], unique: true) {
    id: ID!
    bar: Int!
    baz: [Enum!]
  }
```
