# Self-hosted Archive

Subsquid EVM archives are not yet fully unveiled. For those who want to self-host these right now, two options are available:
* Use the public Archive Docker images. The procedure is described in the [EVM local development tutorial](/tutorials/ethereum-local-development). The tutorial also explains how to use Subsquid with local smart contract development environments such as Hardhat and Ganache.
* Follow the setup instructions in the [Ethereum archive](https://github.com/subsquid/eth-archive) repo.
