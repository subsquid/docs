# Starknet Subsquid Network API

:::warning
The Starknet API of Subsquid Network is currently in beta. Breaking changes may be introduced in the future releases.
:::

Subsquid Network API distributes the requests over a ([potentially decentralized](/subsquid-network/public)) network of _workers_. The main dataset URL now points at a _router_ that provides URLs of workers that do the heavy lifting. Each worker has its own range of blocks that it serves. The recommended data retrieval procedure is as follows:

1. Retrieve the dataset height from the router with `GET /height`.
2. Query the dataset endpoint for an URL of a worker that has the data for the first block of the relevant range with `GET /${firstBlock}/worker`.
3. Retrieve the data from the worker with `POST /`, making sure to set the `"fromBlock"` query field to `${firstBlock}`.
4. Exclude the received blocks from the relevant range by setting `firstBlock` to the value of `header.number` of the last received block plus one.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all the required data is retrieved.

The main URL of the Starknet dataset is
```
https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/starknet-mainnet
```

:::warning
Unlike in [the explorer](https://starkscan.co), addresses in this API do not have leading zeros (both in valid requests and in the returned data). For example, explorer's `0x00ce6c...0552` becomes `0xce6c...0552`. This is the format that Starknet RPC nodes use.

Implementation examples:

<details>

<summary>Manually with cURL</summary>

Suppose we want data on all txs sent by `Layerswap`/`0x19252b1deef483477c4d30cfcc3e5ed9c82fafea44669c182a45a01b4fdb97a` starting from block 600_000. The steps are:

1. Verify that the dataset has reached the required height:
   ```bash
   curl https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/starknet-mainnet/height
   ```
   Output
   ```
   632494
   ```

2. Get a worker URL
   ```bash
   curl https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/starknet-mainnet/600000/worker
   ```
   Output
   ```
   https://rb03.sqd-archive.net/worker/query/czM6Ly9zdGFya25ldC1tYWlubmV0
   ```

3. Retrieve the data from the worker
   ```bash
   curl https://rb03.sqd-archive.net/worker/query/czM6Ly9zdGFya25ldC1tYWlubmV0 \
   -X 'POST' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' \
   -d '{
       "type": "starknet",
       "fromBlock":600000,
       "toBlock":632494,
       "fields":{"transaction":{"transactionHash":true}},
       "transactions":[{"senderAddress":["0x19252b1deef483477c4d30cfcc3e5ed9c82fafea44669c182a45a01b4fdb97a"]}]
   }' | jq
   ```

   Output:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "header": {
         "number": 600000,
         "hash": "0x898fe7f61f5d662199d223de496988f221d150ed054f2fe5e681b2988b9e2c"
       },
       "transactions": []
     },
     {
       "header": {
         "number": 600007,
         "hash": "0x44aa251cee1baaf3f19accefd223ce5208815686c881bf645ffb3e3348a5ddc"
       },
       "transactions": [
         {
           "transactionIndex": 24,
           "transactionHash": "0x6a88edb0713769de4ad4d450df70911c3e9a7e8253c135c9574d0b3542ced18"
         }
       ]
     },
     ...
     {
       "header": {
         "number": 617979,
         "hash": "0x7f6a8516a91eefa6a65972c47002cbe3851e3c4287f670c914850960d29ca29"
       },
       "transactions": []
     }
   ]
   ```

4. Observe that we received the transactions up to and including block 617979. To get the rest of the data, we find a worker who has blocks from 617980 on:
   ```bash
   curl https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/starknet-mainnet/617980/worker
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   https://lm04.sqd-archive.net/worker/query/czM6Ly9zdGFya25ldC1tYWlubmV0
   ```
   We can see that this part of the dataset is located on another host.

5. Retrieve the data from the new worker
   ```bash
   curl https://lm04.sqd-archive.net/worker/query/czM6Ly9zdGFya25ldC1tYWlubmV0 \
   -X 'POST' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' \
   -d '{
       "type": "starknet",
       "fromBlock":617980,
       "toBlock":632494,
       "fields":{"transaction":{"transactionHash":true}},
       "transactions":[{"senderAddress":["0x19252b1deef483477c4d30cfcc3e5ed9c82fafea44669c182a45a01b4fdb97a"]}]
   }' | jq
   ```
   Output is similar to that of step 3.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the dataset height of 632494 reached.

## Data requests

### Transactions

```ts
{
  contractAddress: string[],
  senderAddress: string[],
  type: string[],
  firstNonce: int,
  lastNonce: int,
  events: boolean
}
```
A transaction will be included in the response if it matches all the requests. An empty array matches no transactions; omit all requests to match all transactions.

All events emitted by the selected transactions will be included into the response if `events` is set to `true`.

See [Data field selector](#data-field-selector) for info on field selection.

### Events

```ts
{
  fromAddress: string[],
  key0: string[],
  key1: string[],
  key2: string[],
  key3: string[],
  transaction: boolean
}
```
An event will be included in the response if it matches all the requests. An empty array matches no events; omit all requests to match all events.

If `transaction` is set to `true`, all parent transactions will be included into the response.

See [Data field selector](#data-field-selector) for info on field selection.

## Data fields selector

A selector of fields for the returned data items. Its structure is as follows:

```
{
  block:               // field selector for blocks
  transaction:         // field selector for transactions
  event:               // field selector for events
}
```

### Block fields

```
{
  parentHash
  status
  newRoot
  timestamp
  sequencerAddress
}
```
A valid field selector for blocks is a JSON that has a subset of these fields as keys and `true` as values, e.g. `{"status": true, "timestamp": true}`.

### Transaction fields

```
{
  transactionHash
  contractAddress
  entryPointSelector
  calldata
  maxFee
  type
  senderAddress
  version
  signature
  nonce
  classHash
  compiledClassHash
  contractAddressSalt
  constructorCalldata
}
```
A valid field selector for transactions is a JSON that has a subset of these fields as keys and `true` as values, e.g. `{"transactionHash": true, "type": true, "calldata": true}`.

### Event fields

```ts
{
  fromAddress
  keys
  data
}
```
A valid field selector for logs is a JSON that has a subset of these fields as keys and `true` as values, e.g. `{"fromAddress": true, "data": true}`.
