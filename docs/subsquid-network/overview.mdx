# Overview

SQD Network is a distributed query engine and data lake that the SQD ecosystem is built around.

Currently it serves historical blockchain data for 190+ networks. Compared to data access using a conventional chain node RPC, SQD Network allows one to access data at near zero cost, in a more granular fashion and from multiple blocks at once, thanks to its rich streaming and filtering capabilities.

There are currently two independent instances of SQD Network:

1. A decentralized permissionless network.

2. A permissioned network ran by Subsquid Labs GmbH. It's been used by 400+ indexers in production. [List of supported networks](/subsquid-network/reference/networks).

Both variants are freely accessible to public using the same [API](/subsquid-network/reference).

If you are a network developer and would like to see your chain supported by SQD, please fill a [form](https://forms.gle/ioVNFiPjZgvUNunY9) or contact us in [SquidDevs Telegram chat](https://t.me/HydraDevs).

## Permissionless public network

The decentralized version of SQD Network is now in the mainnet phase. It serves data for almost [all networks](/subsquid-network/reference/networks) supported by the [private cluster](#open-private-network), with the (temporary) exception of Solana.

The most recent version of the data access node, SQD portal, fetches data chunks from multiple worker nodes in parallel and exposes a streaming API. It is now in a closed beta.

You can participate in the public network by [running a worker](/subsquid-network/participate/worker) or reward good workers by [delegating SQD tokens](/subsquid-network/participate/delegate) and sharing in profits.

## Open private network

SQD's private data lake (formerly known as Archives) is a production-ready fork of early SQD Network that runs on SQD infrastructure. It provides a stand-in for the permissionless SQD Network until it matures; its [API](/subsquid-network/reference) shares many similarities with the SQD portal API.

The gateway of this private network is public and free to query. URLs of gateways of supported networks are available via [`sqd gateways list`](/squid-cli/gateways) and from the exhaustive [public gateways list](/subsquid-network/reference/networks).
