# Procuring SQD

Participating in SQD Network usually requires some amount of SQD tokens. This page details all the ways in which you can get some of these.

## General considerations

1. The correct SQD token contracts are
   - on Arbitrum: [0x1337420dED5ADb9980CFc35f8f2B054ea86f8aB1](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1337420dED5ADb9980CFc35f8f2B054ea86f8aB1)
   - on Base: [0xd4554BEa546EFa83C1E6B389ecac40EA999B3E78](https://basescan.org/address/0xd4554bea546efa83c1e6b389ecac40ea999b3e78)
   - on Ethereum: [0x1337420dED5ADb9980CFc35f8f2B054ea86f8aB1](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1337420ded5adb9980cfc35f8f2b054ea86f8ab1)

2. To be accessible for the SQD Network contracts the tokens must be on the Arbitrum One network.

3. The most convenient way to interact with the contracts is the [SQD network app](https://network.subsquid.io). You'll need a browser wallet to use it. Supported options:
