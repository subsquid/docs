description: Introducing Subsquid, an on-chain data indexing framework and a platform for serverless Web3 APIs.
---

# Overview

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io/) framework is a set of tools to ingest, transform and present blockchain data.
[Aquarium](https://app.subsquid.io) is a cloud service for deploying and managing projects built with the Subsquid framework, called **squids**.

Our current focus is on [substrate](https://substrate.io)-based chains,
with support for EVM-based chains and other L1s coming next.

## Quickstart

A [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) guide to run a "Hello World" squid indexing Kusama transfers in 15 minutes.

## Build a squid

A comprehensive reference covering API modeling, interfaces for handling Substrate and EVM data, and tooling needed to [build a custom squid](/docs/develop-a-squid/).

## Deploy your squid 

[Deploy and publish](/docs/deploy-squid) to Aquairum using Squid CLI.

## Migration from earlier versions

If you have an existing project and need to migrate to the latest Squid version, follow this [Guide](/docs/guides/migrate-to-fire-squid).

## Bug bounties and community support

As for help or report any issues to our cozy community [Dev Chat](https://t.me/HydraDevs) on Telegram. Also keep an eye on [Github Issues](https://github.com/subsquid/squid/issues) labeled `$` -- these bounties are up for grabs!
