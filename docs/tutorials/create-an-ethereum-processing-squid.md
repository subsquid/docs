# Create an EVM-indexing Squid

## Objective

This tutorial will take the Squid Ethereum template and go through all the necessary steps to customize the project, in order to interact with a different Squid Archive, synchronized with the Ethereum blockchain, and process data from a specific contract ([the Exosama NFT collection](https://exosama.com/)), with substantial configuration changes to what is defined in the template.

The business logic to process these contract is basic, and that is on purpose since the Tutorial aims show a simple case, highlighting the changes a developer would typically apply to the template, removing unnecessary complexity.

In this example we will be connecting to the [Ethereum mainnet](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-mainnet) and the final objective will be to show the tokens that are part of the contract, who owns them and every time they have been transferred.
The tutorial applies to other EVM chains (Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, etc). The only difference is the Archive endpoint set during the [processor configuration](/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/configuration).

If you want to look at the end result, or inspect the code, the project of this tutorial is available at [this repository](https://github.com/subsquid/subsquid-ethereum-tutorial-example).

## Pre-requisites

The minimum requirements for this tutorial are as follows:

- Familiarity with Git 
- A properly set up [development environment](/tutorials/development-environment-set-up)
- Basic command line knowledge 
- Setup [Squid CLI](/squid-cli)

## Scaffold using `sqd init`

We will start of the `evm` template of [`sqd init`](/squid-cli/init) which is based on this [repository](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-evm-template).

```bash
sqd init evm-tutorial --template evm
cd evm-tutorial
```

## Define Entity Schema

The next thing to do, in order to customize the project for our own purpose, is to make changes to the schema and define the Entities we want to keep track of.

Luckily, the EVM template already contains a schema that defines the exact entities we need for the purpose of this guide. For this reason, changes are necessary, but it's still useful to explain what is going on.

To index ERC-721 token transfers, we will need to track:

* Token transfers
* Ownership of tokens
* Contracts and their minted tokens

And the `schema.graphql` file defines them like this:

```graphql
type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
  owner: Owner
  uri: String
  transfers: [Transfer!]! @derivedFrom(field: "token")
  contract: Contract
}
 
type Owner @entity {
  id: ID!
  ownedTokens: [Token!]! @derivedFrom(field: "owner")
  balance: BigInt! @index
}
 
type Contract @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @index
  symbol: String! @index
  # contract URI updated once e.g. a day
  contractURI: String
  address: String
  # timestamp when the contract URI was updated last
  contractURIUpdated: BigInt @index
  totalSupply: BigInt!
  mintedTokens: [Token!]! @derivedFrom(field: "contract")
}
 
type Transfer @entity {
  id: ID!
  token: Token!
  from: Owner
  to: Owner
  timestamp: BigInt! @index
  block: Int! @index
  transactionHash: String! @index
}
```

It's worth noting a couple of things in this [schema definition](https://docs.subsquid.io/reference/openreader-schema):

* **`@entity`** - signals that this type will be translated into an ORM model that is going to be persisted in the database
* **`@derivedFrom`** - signals the field will not be persisted on the database, it will rather be derived
* **type references** (i.e. `from: Owner`) - establishes a relation between two entities
* **`@index`** - signals that the field should be indexed by the database. Very useful for increasing the performance on fields queried often.

The template already has automatically generated TypeScript classes for this schema definition. They can be found under `src/model/generated`.

Whenever changes are made to the schema, new TypeScript entity classes have to be generated, and to do that you'll have to run the `codegen` tool:

```bash
npx squid-typeorm-codegen
```

## ABI Definition and Wrapper

Squid SDK offers the `evm-typegen` tool for generating type-safe facade classes for decoding EVM smart contract transaction and log data. It uses the [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) library under the hood and requires the contract [Application Binary Interface (ABI)](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/abi/) as input. It accepts a local or remote path to the contract ABI, and also supports fetching public ABIs using an Etherscan-like API. See [the `evm-typegen` page](/develop-a-squid/typegen/squid-evm-typegen) for more details.

In our case, we take the Exosama smart contract ABI from an external repo `subsquid/exosama-marketplace-squid`. The `exo` suffix after the `#` delimiter indicates the basename (`exo`) for the generated classes in the target (`src/abi`) folder.
```bash
npx squid-evm-typegen src/abi https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subsquid/exosama-marketplace-squid/master/src/abi/ExosamaCollection.json#exo --clean
```

:::info
For contacts with public ABIs, `squid-evm-typegen` can fetch the ABI by address using the Etherescan API. For example: 

```bash
npx squid-evm-typegen src/abi 0xac5c7493036de60e63eb81c5e9a440b42f47ebf5#my-contract 
```
For more details, consult the built-in help with `npx squid-evm-typegen --help`.

**Caveat:** in the wild, many contracts employ the [transparent proxy pattern](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) and only expose the ABI for contract updates. To index the ongoing contract activity one must use the ABI of the implementation contract. To find this contract, visit the Etherscan page of the proxy contract, go to the "Contract" tab of contract details and look for the "Read as Proxy" button.

### Managing the EVM contract

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to hardcode the information of the contract itself, including the total supply, the token name, and symbol. While this information can actually be sourced by accessing the state of the contract on-chain, this would have added complexity to the project. To isolate this part of our codebase, and potentially make it easier to improve it in the future, let's create a file named `src/contract.ts`, which will contain:

* The chain node endpoint (necessary for accessing the contract state). If you don't have access to a private Ethereum node endpoint, you can search for a public one [here](https://ethereumnodes.com/), be sure to use a WebSocket endpoint.
* The contract's address (`0xac5c7493036de60e63eb81c5e9a440b42f47ebf5`)
* A singleton instance of the `Contract` model, abstracting the database
* A function that will create and save an instance of `Contract` on the database, if one does not exist already. This is where the hardcoded values will go, for now.

Here is the entire content of the file:

```typescript
// src/contract.ts
import { Store } from "@subsquid/typeorm-store";
import { Contract } from "./model";

export const contractAddress = "0xac5c7493036de60e63eb81c5e9a440b42f47ebf5";

let contractEntity: Contract | undefined;

export async function getOrCreateContractEntity(store: Store): Promise<Contract> {
  if (contractEntity == null) {
    contractEntity = await store.get(Contract, contractAddress);
    if (contractEntity == null) {
      contractEntity = new Contract({
        id: contractAddress,
        name: "Exosama",
        symbol: "EXO",
        totalSupply: 10000n,
      });
      await store.insert(contractEntity);
    }
  }
  return contractEntity;
}

```

## Define logic to handle and save Events & Function calls

The Subsquid SDK provides users with the `EvmBatchProcessor`, that connects to the [Subsquid archive](/overview) to get chain data and apply custom transformation. It will index from the starting block, until the end block (if these are set in the configuration), or until new data is added to the chain.

The processor exposes methods to "subscribe" to EVM logs or smart contract function calls. These methods can be configured by specifying the EVM log contract address, and the signature of the EVM event, for example. The actual data processing is then started by calling the `.run()` function. This will start generating requests to the Archive for *batches* of the data specified in the configuration, and will trigger the callback function, or *batch handler* (passed to `.run()` as second argument) every time a batch is returned by the Archive itself.

It is in this callback function that all the mapping logic is expressed. This is where Event and Function decoding should be implemented, and where the code to save processed data on the database should be defined.

:::info
The ABI defines the signatures of all events in the contract. The `Transfer` event has three arguments, named: `from`, `to`, and `tokenId`. Their types are, respectively, `address`, `address`, and `uint256`. 
:::

## Configure Processor and Batch Handler

The `src/processor.ts` file is where the template project instantiates the `EvmBatchProcessor` class, configures it for execution, and attaches the handler functions.

We have to make substantial changes here, and add the bulk of our logic. Here is a list of tasks that the code in this file should accomplish:

* Instantiate `TypeormDatabase` and `EvmBatchProcessor` classes (already present)
* Configure the processor by setting the block range, the Archive and RPC node endpoints, and subscribe to logs of the Exosama contract with the `setBlockRange`, `setDataSource` and `addLog` functions, respectively
* Declare a function to handle the EVM logs, using the decoding functions defined in `exo.ts` by the `evm-typegen` tool
* Declare a second function to save all the data extracted from the batch in one go. Saving vectors of models, instead of a single instance at a time will guarantee a much better performance and it is the preferred way to go
* Call the `processor.run()` function to start the data processing. This will unbundle the batch of EVM logs and use the previous two functions to handle and save data

And here is a code snippet with the final result:

```typescript
// src/processor.ts
import { lookupArchive } from "@subsquid/archive-registry";
import { Store, TypeormDatabase } from "@subsquid/typeorm-store";
import { EvmBatchProcessor, BlockHandlerContext, LogHandlerContext } from "@belopash/evm-processor";
import { In } from "typeorm";
import { BigNumber } from "ethers";
import {
  CHAIN_NODE,
  contractAddress,
  getOrCreateContractEntity,
} from "./contract";
import { Owner, Token, Transfer } from "./model";
import * as exo from "./abi/exo";

const database = new TypeormDatabase();
const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setBlockRange({ from: 15584000 })
  .setDataSource({
    chain: process.env.RPC_ENDPOINT,
    archive: 'https://eth.archive.subsquid.io',
  })
  .addLog(contractAddress, {
    filter: [[exo.events.Transfer.topic]],
    data: {
      evmLog: {
        topics: true,
        data: true,
      },
      transaction: {
        hash: true,
      },
    },
  });

processor.run(database, async (ctx) => {
  const transfersData: TransferData[] = [];

  for (const block of ctx.blocks) {
    for (const item of block.items) {
      if (item.kind === "evmLog") {
        if (item.address === contractAddress) {
          const transfer = handleTransfer({
            ...ctx,
            block: block.header,
            ...item,
          });

          transfersData.push(transfer);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  await saveTransfers({
    ...ctx,
    block: ctx.blocks[ctx.blocks.length - 1].header,
  }, transfersData);
});

type TransferData = {
  id: string;

  const { evmLog, transaction, block } = ctx;
  const addr = evmLog.address.toLowerCase()

  const { from, to, tokenId } = exo.events.Transfer.decode(evmLog);

  const transfer: TransferData = {
    id: `${transaction.hash}-${addr}-${tokenId.toBigInt()}-${evmLog.index}`,
    tokenId: tokenId.toBigInt(),
    from,
    to,
    timestamp: BigInt(block.timestamp),
    block: block.height,
    transactionHash: transaction.hash,
  };

  return transfer;
}

async function saveTransfers(ctx: BlockHandlerContext<Store>, transfersData: TransferData[]) {
  const tokensIds: Set<string> = new Set();
  const ownersIds: Set<string> = new Set();

  for (const transferData of transfersData) {
    tokensIds.add(transferData.tokenId.toString());
    ownersIds.add(transferData.from);
    ownersIds.add(transferData.to);
  }

  const transfers: Set<Transfer> = new Set();

  const tokens: Map<string, Token> = new Map(
    (await ctx.store.findBy(Token, { id: In([...tokensIds]) })).map((token) => [
      token.id,
      token,
    ])
  );

  const owners: Map<string, Owner> = new Map(
    (await ctx.store.findBy(Owner, { id: In([...ownersIds]) })).map((owner) => [
      owner.id,
      owner,
    ])
  );
  
  for (const transferData of transfersData) {

    let from = owners.get(transferData.from);
    if (from == null) {
      from = new Owner({ id: transferData.from, balance: 0n });
      owners.set(from.id, from);
    }

    let to = owners.get(transferData.to);
    if (to == null) {
      to = new Owner({ id: transferData.to, balance: 0n });
      owners.set(to.id, to);
    }

    const tokenIdString = transferData.tokenId.toString();

    let token = tokens.get(tokenIdString);

    if (token == null) {
      token = new Token({
        id: tokenIdString,
        //uri: to be set later 
        contract: await getOrCreateContractEntity(ctx.store),
      });
      tokens.set(token.id, token);
    }
    token.owner = to;

    const { id, block, transactionHash, timestamp } = transferData;

    const transfer = new Transfer({
      id,
      block,
      timestamp,
      transactionHash,
      from,
      to,
      token,
    });

    transfers.add(transfer);
  }

  const maxHeight = maxBy(transfersData, t => t.block)!.block; 
  // Multicall will query the state at the max height of the chunk
  const multicall = new Multicall(ctx, {height: maxHeight}, MULTICALL_ADDRESS)

  ctx.log.info(`Calling mutlicall for ${transfersData.length} tokens...`)
  // query EXOSAMA_NFT_CONTRACT.tokenURI(tokenId) in chunks of size 100
  const results = await multicall.tryAggregate(functions.tokenURI, transfersData.map(t => [EXOSAMA_NFT_CONTRACT, [BigNumber.from(t.tokenId)]] as [string, any[]]), 100);

  results.forEach((res, i) => {
    let t = tokens.get(transfersData[i].tokenId.toString());
    if (t) {
      let uri = '';
      if (res.success) {
        uri = <string>res.value;
      } else if (res.returnData) {
        uri = <string>functions.tokenURI.tryDecodeResult(res.returnData) || '';
      }
    }
  });
  ctx.log.info(`Done`);
  
  await ctx.store.save([...owners.values()]);
  await ctx.store.save([...tokens.values()]);
  await ctx.store.save([...transfers]);
}
```

:::info
Pay close attention to the line with `const results = await multicall.tryAggregate(...)`. This is an example of how to aggregate multiple contract calls using the [MakerDAO Multicall Contract](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall). It significantly increases the sync speed of the squid by reducing the number of JSON RPC requests. The first argument is `function.tokenURI` corresponds to the `tokenURI()` view method of the `EXOSAMA_NFT_CONTRACT` contract, and the second argument
```ts
transfersData.map(t => [EXOSAMA_NFT_CONTRACT, [BigNumber.from(t.tokenId)]] as [string, any[]])
```
tells that it should be called with a single argument `tokenId` for each entity in the `transfersData` array.
The last argument `100` corresponds to the page size, meaning that `tryAggreagate` splits the incoming array of calls to be executed into chunks of size `100`. If the page size is too large, the RPC node may time out or bounce the request.

For more details on see the Multicall section of the [`evm-typegen` page](/develop-a-squid/typegen/squid-evm-typegen)

:::warning
The tutorial uses a public JSON RPC endpoint set by the variable `RPC_ENDPOINT` defined in the `.env` file. For production squids we recommend using private endpoints set via [secrets](/deploy-squid/env-variables)

## Launch and Set Up the Database

When running the project locally, as it is the case for this guide, it is possible to use the `docker-compose.yml` file that comes with the template to launch a PostgreSQL container. To do so, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

![Launch database container](https://i.gyazo.com/907ef55371e1cdb1839d2fe7ff108ee7.gif)

!!! Note The `-d` parameter is optional, it launches the container in `daemon` mode, so the terminal will not be blocked, and no further output will be visible.

Squid projects automatically manage the database connection and schema, via an [ORM abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational\_mapping).

The Subsquid SDK uses migration files, which apply the defined schema to the underlying database. Because we made changes to the schema, we need to remove existing migration(s) and create a new one, before applying the new migration to the database.

To set up the database, you can take the following steps:

1. Build the code

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Make sure the Postgres Docker container, `squid-template_db_1`, is running (exact name of the container could be slightly different)

    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

3. Remove existing migration(s), they are placed under the `db/migrations` folder

    ```bash
    rm db/migrations/*js
    ```

4. Generate the new migration

    ```bash
    npx squid-typeorm-migration generate
    ```
5. Apply the migration, so tables are created on the database

    ```bash
    npx squid-typeorm-migration apply
    ```

## Launch the Project

To launch the processor (this will block the current terminal), you can run the following command:

```bash
make process
```
:::info
This is an example of some of the command shortcuts that can be found in `Makefile`. Feel free to use them, to increase your productivity.
:::

![Launch processor](https://i.gyazo.com/66ab9c1fef9203d3e24b6e274bba47e3.gif)

Finally, in a separate terminal window, launch the GraphQL server:

```bash
npx squid-graphql-server
```

Visit [`localhost:4350/graphql`](http://localhost:4350/graphql) to access the [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) console. From this window, you can perform queries such as this one, to find out the account owners with the biggest balances:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  owners(limit: 10, orderBy: balance_DESC) {
    balance
    id
  }
}
```

Have some fun playing around with queries, after all, it's a _playground_!
