# Quickstart

This quickstart guide presents a simplified method for development environment setup and for running a squid that queries Kusama. 

The steps outlined in this guide should only take around five minutes.
## Pre-requisites

Before getting to work on your very first squid, verify that you have installed the following software: 

- Node v16.x
- Docker 
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Please note:
- The squid template is **not** compatible with `yarn`. Use `npm` instead.
- Windows users are recommended to install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

Additional information about development environment setup is available [here](/tutorials/development-environment-set-up).

## Step 1: Clone <span><a href="https://github.com/subsquid/squid-template">squid-template</a></span>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subsquid/squid-template.git
cd squid-template
```

##  Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

## Step 3: Build the squid

```bash
make build
```

## Step 4: Launch Postgres and detach

```bash
make up
```


## Step 5: Create the database schema and run the processor

 The squid we have just built ingests pre-indexed data from a Kusama Archive. This data is then transformed, as defined by the data handler in `processor.ts`.
 
 This command will keep the console busy until manually terminated:

```bash
make process
```



## Step 6: Start the GraphQL server

This should be run in a separate terminal window:

```bash
make serve
```

The GraphQL playground is available at `http://localhost:4350/graphql`. Open it in a browser and run
sample queries by applying filters and data selections in the panel to the left.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  accountsConnection(orderBy: id_ASC) {
    totalCount
  }
}
```
