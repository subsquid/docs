# Quickstart


## Pre-requisites

- node 16.x
- docker
- npm (the template is not compatible with `yarn`)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

On Windows we recommend using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

For more information on how to set up the Development Environment, take a look at the [Tutorial on this topic](/docs/tutorials/development-environment-set-up)


## Clone <span><a href="https://github.com/subsquid/squid-template">squid-template</a></span>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subsquid/squid-template.git 
cd squid-template
```

##  Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

## Build the squid

```bash
make build
```

##  Launch Postgres and detach

```bash
make up
```


## Create the database schema and run the processor

 The squid processor ingests pre-indexed on-chain data from Kusama archive and transforms it as 
 defined by the data handler in `processor.ts`.
 This command is blocking.

```bash
make process
```



##  Start the GraphQL server 

Run in a separate terminal window

```bash
make serve
```

The GraphQL playground is available on `http://localhost:4350/graphql`. Open it in a browser and run
sample queries by choosing the filters and data selection on the left-hand pane. 

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  accountsConnection(orderBy: id_ASC) {
    totalCount
  }
}
```

- [Define your own data handlers](./develop-a-squid/squid-processor)
- [Deploy the squid](./deploy-squid)
