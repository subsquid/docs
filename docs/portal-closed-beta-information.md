# SQD Portal Closed Beta Instructions

Welcome to the SQD Portal Closed Beta! We appreciate your interest. Below, you’ll find clear instructions on what to do next and what to expect.

## What is the SQD Portal?

The SQD Portal is a decentralized, streaming-based data retrieval solution designed to replace our centralized archives. It provides faster, more reliable, and flexible access to blockchain data.

#### Key Features

- **Fully Decentralized**: Powered by 1,600+ independent worker nodes.
- **30x Replication**: Redundant data storage for maximum reliability, capable of querying up to **20 million blocks per second**.
- **Faster Performance**: A new Rust-based query engine now leverages parallelized queries and incorporates numerous query execution performance optimizations, delivering an overall **10-50x performance boost** compared to the centralized Archives.

## What You Can Do


### 1. Explore the Public Portal

- Access data for 100+ EVM networks during the closed beta. Public Portal supports filtering only by logs at the moment. We aim to include all full filtering capabilities in the general availability release ([reference](https://docs.sqd.dev/subsquid-network/reference/evm-api/)) and other VMs as well.
- Note: The current Public Portal rate limit is 20 requests per 10 seconds.
