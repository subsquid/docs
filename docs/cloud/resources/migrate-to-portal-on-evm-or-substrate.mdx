# Migrate to the Cloud portal

## For users on EVM and Substrate networks

:::info
SQD Network portals are currently in beta. Please report any bugs or suggestions to the [SQD Portal Beta chat](https://t.me/+JHrJZPz34kRjYmFk) or to [Squid Devs](https://t.me/HydraDevs).
:::

This guide walks you through replacing a gateway of the [open private version of SQD Network](/subsquid-network/overview/#open-private-network) with a *portal* of the [permissionless SQD Network](/subsquid-network/overview/#permissionless-public-network) as the primary source of data for your Cloud squids.
<!--
Benefits include:

 - **Reduced reliance on centralized services:** The permissionless SQD Network consists of [over 1400](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x36e2b147db67e76ab67a4d07c293670ebefcae4e#readContract#F6) nodes [ran by independent operators](/subsquid-network/participate/worker)
 - **Improved stability:** With a total capacity of roughly 1.1Pb, the permissionless SQD Network allows for a great deal of redundancy.
 - **Improved speed:** The permissionless version of SQD Network has a lot more bandwidth than the open private network; moreover, portals use the available bandwidth more effectively than gateways. Data fetching was 5-10 times faster in some of our tests. For squids that are not bottlenecked by write operations this will translate into better sync performance.
 - **Being future-proof:** All future development will be focused on portals and the permissionless SQD Network. Open private network will be sunset around May 2025.
-->
SQD team operates two independent portals that serve the needs of Cloud users:
 * The dedicated **Cloud Portal** is only visible from within the Cloud, ensuring stable performance for squids deployed there.
 * The **Public Portal** can be accessed from anywhere for easy experimentation and local development.

:::info
We're currently experimenting with tightening the data request complexity limits. If you see an HTTP 400 error with a message like this:
```
Couldn't parse query: query contains X item requests, but only 50 is allowed
```
where `X` is some number above 50, or any other HTTP 400 response, please let us know.

Here are the steps to migrate:

## Step 1: update to @latest packages

**A.** Enter your squid's folder.

**B.** Remove both your lock file and the `node_modules` folder:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs queryString="package-manager">
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
```
```bash
rm -r node_modules package-lock.json
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
```
```bash
rm -r node_modules yarn.lock
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
```
```bash
rm -r node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

**C.** Upgrade all SQD packages to the `@latest` major version:
```bash
npx --yes npm-check-updates --filter "@subsquid/*" --upgrade
```

**D.** Install the dependencies:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs queryString="package-manager">
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
```
```bash
npm install
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
```
```bash
yarn install
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
```
```bash
pnpm install
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Step 2: tell your code to use the Portal

Follow the network-specific instructions from the Cloud:

 * navigate to [the Portal's page](https://app.subsquid.io/portal)
 * click on the tile of your network to see the instructions

Once you're done, your squid will use the Cloud Portal when deployed and the public portal for local runs.

## Step 3 (recommended): testing

If you just want to update your squid code to use the Portal-enabled SDK version you can simply redeploy your squid here and be done. No need to re-sync.

However, for the duration of this beta we strongly recommend that you re-sync your squid. This will allow you to make sure everything is working as it should and evaluate the improved data source performance. Follow the zero-downtime update procedure:

1. Deploy your squid into a new slot.

2. Wait for it to sync, observing the improved data fetching.

3. Assign your production tag to the new deployment to redirect the GraphQL requests there.

See [this section](/cloud/resources/slots-and-tags/#zero-downtime-updates) for details.

## What's next?

Stay hyped for news on the introduction of real time data to EVM and Substate - it is coming soon.
