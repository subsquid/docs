# GraphQL API Server

The squid data can be presented with a GraphQL API. The [OpenReader](https://github.com/subsquid/squid/tree/master/openreader) server takes the schema file as an input argument and starts a GraphQL API serving [OpenCRUD](https://www.opencrud.org/) read queries for the entities defined in the schema. 

To start the API server:
```bash
npx make serve
```

The API server listens at port defined by `GQL_PORT` (default to `4350`). The database connection is configured with the env variables `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`.

The API server is automatically started when the squid is [deployed to the Aquarium](/deploy-squid).

## Supported Queries

The details of the supported OpenReader queries can be found in a separate section [Query a Squid](/query-squid). Here is a brief overview of the queries generated by OpenReader for each entity defined in the schema file:

- the squid last processed block is available with `squidStatus { height }` query 
- a "get one by ID" query with the name `{entityName}ById`
- a "get one" query for [`@unique` fields](/basics/schema-file/indexes-and-constraints), with the name `{entityName}ByUniqueInput`
- a lookup query with the name `{entityName}s`. It supports filtering on each entity field with a `where` parameter, predicate compositions with `AND` and `OR` and limiting with the `offset` and `limit` parameters.
- a [GraphQL Cursor pagination](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) query with the name `{entityName}sConnection`

Nested queries are supported out-of-the-box for entity relations:
- for the `one` side of a relation, `where` supports filtering on any field of the related entity
- for the `many` side of a relation, `where` supports filters `XXX_some`, `XXX_every` and `XXX_none` that match only if at least one (resp. each and none) of the related entities match the predicate.

[Union and typed JSON types](/basics/schema-file/unions-and-typed-json) are mapped into [GraphQL Union Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types) with a proper type resolution with `__typename`.

## Built-in custom scalars

The OpenReader GraphQL API defines the following custom scalars in the GraphQL to present the corresponding entity fields:

- `DateTime`: `DateTime` fields in the schema are presented in the ISO format
- `Bytes`: `Bytes` fields are presented as hex-encoded strings prefixed with `0x`
- `BigInt`: `BigInt` fields are presented as strings
