# Custom GraphQL resolvers

One can extend the GraphQL API generated by OpenReader with custom queries. To do that, one can define GraphQL [query resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/) in the designated module `src/server-extension/resolvers`. Note that all resolver classes (including any additional types) must be exported by `src/server-extension/resolvers/index.ts`.

A custom resolver should import [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/docs/resolvers.html) types and use annotations provided by the library to define query arguments and return types.

Custom resolvers are normally used in combination with [TypeORM EntityManager](https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/entity-manager-api) for accessing the API server target database. It is automatically injected when defined as a single constructor argument of the resolver.

A custom resolver may then look as follows:

```typescript
import { Arg, Field, ObjectType, Query, Resolver } from 'type-graphql'
import type { EntityManager } from 'typeorm'
import { MyEntity } from '../../model/generated'

// Define custom GraphQL ObjectType of the query result
@ObjectType()
export class MyQueryResult {
  @Field(() => Number, { nullable: false })
  total!: number

  @Field(() => Number, { nullable: false })
  max!: number

  constructor(props: Partial<MyQueryResult>) {
    Object.assign(this, props);
  }
}

@Resolver()
export class MyResolver {
  // Set by depenency injection
  constructor(private tx: () => Promise<EntityManager>) {}

  @Query(() => [MyQueryResult])
  async myQuery(): Promise<MyQueryResult[]> {
    const manager = await this.tx()
    // execute custom SQL query
    const result: = await manager.getRepository(MyEntity).query(
      `SELECT 
        COUNT(x) as total, 
        MAX(y) as max
      FROM my_entity 
      GROUP BY month`)
    return result
  }
}
```

Some great examples of `@subsquid/graphql-server`-based custom resolvers can be spotted in the wild in the [Rubik repo](https://github.com/kodadot/rubick/tree/main/src/server-extension/resolvers) by KodaDot.
