# Indexing transaction receipts

In this step-by-step tutorial we will look into a squid that indexes [Fuel Network](https://fuel.network/) data.

Pre-requisites: Node.js v20 or newer, Git, Docker.

## Download the project

Begin by retrieving the template and installing the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subsquid-labs/fuel-example
cd fuel-example
npm i
```

## Configuring the data source

"Data source" is a component that defines what data should be retrieved and where to get it. To configure the data source to retrieve the data produced by the `receipt` field of the fuel transaction, we initialize it like this:
```typescript title="src/main.ts"
const dataSource = new DataSourceBuilder()
  .setGateway('https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-mainnet')
  .setGraphql({
    url: 'https://mainnet.fuel.network/v1/graphql',
    strideConcurrency: 3,
    strideSize: 50
  })
  .setFields({
    receipt: {
      contract: true,
      receiptType: true
    }
  })
  .addReceipt({
    type: ['LOG_DATA']
  })
  .build()
```

Here,
* `https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-mainnet` is the address for the public SQD Network gateway for Fuel. Check out the exhaustive [public gateways list](/subsquid-network/reference/networks).
* The argument of [`addReceipt()`](/fuel-indexing/fuel-datasource/receipts) is a set of filters that tells the processor to retrieve all receipts of type `LOG`.
* The argument of [`setFields()`](/fuel-indexing/fuel-datasource/field-selection) specifies the exact fields we need for every data item type. In this case we request `contract` and `receiptType` for receipt data items.

See also [`FuelDataSource` reference](/fuel-indexing/fuel-datasource) and the comments in `main.ts` of the `fuel-example` repo.

With a data source it becomes possible to retrieve filtered blockchain data from [SQD Network](/subsquid-network/overview), transform it and save the result to a destination of choice.
## Decoding the event data

The other part of the squid processor (the ingester process of the indexer) is the callback function used to process batches of the filtered data, the [batch handler](/sdk/reference/processors/architecture/#processorrun). In Fuel Squid SDK it is typically defined within a `run()` call, like this:
```typescript
import {run} from '@subsquid/batch-processor'

run(dataSource, database, async ctx => {
  // data transformation and persistence code here
})
```
Here,
* `dataSource` is the data source object described in the previous section
* `database` is a [`Database` implementation](/sdk/resources/persisting-data/overview/) specific to the target data sink. We want to store the data in a PostgreSQL database and present with a GraphQL API, so we provide a [`TypeormDatabase`](/sdk/resources/persisting-data/typeorm/) object here.
* `ctx` is a [batch context](/sdk/reference/processors/architecture/#batch-context) object that exposes a batch of data (at `ctx.blocks`) and any data persistence facilities derived from `db` (at `ctx.store`). See [Block data for Fuel](/fuel-indexing/fuel-datasource/context-interfaces/) for details on how the data batches are presented.

Batch handler is where the raw on-chain data is decoded, transformed and persisted. This is the part we'll be concerned with for the rest of the tutorial.

We begin by defining a database and starting the data processing:
```typescript title="src/main.ts"
run(dataSource, database, async ctx => {
  // Block items that we get from `ctx.blocks` are flat JS objects.
  //
  // We can use `augmentBlock()` function from `@subsquid/fuel-objects`
  // to enrich block items with references to related objects.
  let contracts: Map<String, Contract> = new Map()

  let blocks = ctx.blocks.map(augmentBlock)

  for (let block of blocks) {
    for (let receipt of block.receipts) {
      if (receipt.receiptType == 'LOG_DATA' && receipt.contract != null) {
        let contract = contracts.get(receipt.contract)
        if (!contract) {
          contract = await ctx.store.findOne(Contract, {where: {id: receipt.contract}})
          if (!contract) {
            contract = new Contract({
              id: receipt.contract,
              logsCount: 0,
              foundAt: block.header.height
            })
          }
        }
        contract.logsCount += 1
        contracts.set(contract.id, contract)
      }
    }
  }

  ctx.store.upsert([...contracts.values()])
})
```
This goes through all the receipts in the block, verifies that they have type `LOG_DATA"`, reads the contract field from the receipt and saves it to the database.

At this point the squid is ready for its first test run. Execute
```bash
npx tsc
docker compose up -d
npx squid-typeorm-migration apply
node -r dotenv/config lib/main.js
```
You can verify that the data is being stored in the database by running
```bash
docker exec "$(basename "$(pwd)")-db-1" psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM contract"
```
