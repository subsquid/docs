# Fuel SQD Network API

:::warning
The Fuel API of SQD Network is currently in beta. Breaking changes may be introduced in the future releases.
:::

SQD Network API distributes the requests over a ([potentially decentralized](/subsquid-network/faq)) network of _workers_. The main gateway URL points at a _router_ that provides URLs of workers that do the heavy lifting. Each worker has its own range of blocks on each dataset it serves.

Suppose you want to retrieve an output of some [query](#worker-api) on a block range starting at `firstBlock` (can be the genesis block) and ending at the highest available block. Proceed as follows:

1. Retrieve the dataset height from the router with `GET /height` and make sure it's above `firstBlock`.

2. Save the value of `firstBlock` to some variable, say `currentBlock`.

3. Query the router for an URL of a worker that has the data for `currentBlock` with `GET /${currentBlock}/worker`.

4. Retrieve the data from the worker by [posting the query](#worker-api) (`POST /`), setting the `"fromBlock"` query field to `${currentBlock}`.

5. Parse the retrieved data to get a batch of query data **plus** the height of the last block available from the current worker. Take the `header.number` field of the last element of the retrieved JSON array - it is the height you want. Even if your query returns no data, you'll still get the block data for the last block in the range, so this procedure is safe.

6. Set `currentBlock` to the height from the previous step **plus one**.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 until all the required data is retrieved.

The main gateway URL for Fuel Mainnet is

```
https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-mainnet
```

Implementation examples:

<details>

<summary>Manually with cURL</summary>

Suppose we want data on Fuel receipts from block `1000000`. We begin by finding the main URL for the Fuel Mainnet dataset. Then we have to:

1. Retrieve the dataset height from the router with

   ```bash
   curl https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-mainnet/height
   ```

   Output

   ```
   1211611
   ```

2. Save the value `1000000` to some variable, say `currentBlock`.

3. Query the router for an URL of a worker that has the data for`currentBlock`

   ```bash
   curl https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/fuel-mainnet/1000000/worker
   ```

   Output

   ```
   https://rb03.sqd-archive.net/worker/query/czM6Ly9mdWVsLXRlc3RuZXQ
   ```

4. Retrieve the data from the worker

   ```bash
   curl https://rb03.sqd-archive.net/worker/query/czM6Ly9mdWVsLXRlc3RuZXQ \
   -X 'POST' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' \
   -d '{
       "type": "fuel",
       "fromBlock":1000000,
       "fields":{"receipt":{"contract":true, "receiptType": true}},
       "receipts":[ {"type": ["LOG_DATA"]} ]
   }' | jq
   ```

   Output:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "header": {
         "number": 1000000,
         "hash": "0xdc31db7fa3c1fb4f3e0910dc5abf927e64cc985eb2eb13418a9f2e00c4b7ad23"
       },
       "receipts": []
     },
     {
       "header": {
         "number": 1002527,
         "hash": "0x649f045675405f9d4ee34bb19479d0e5706ed14615e8f97da9f34dd166e37f35"
       },
       "receipts": [
         {
           "transactionIndex": 0,
           "index": 1,
           "contract": "0xe637b4c254aa07baa9845eb9f8c7ad0965fad5c5b1194cb37193f956be0ce6f3",
           "receiptType": "LOG_DATA"
         }
       ]
     },
     ...
     {
       "header": {
         "number": 1211611,
         "hash": "0x04c9ef60f2b54d32569a410477c136f11b692c1d3eadaa5b946a0295b526223e"
       },
       "receipts": []
     }
   ]
   ```

5. Parse the retrieved data to get a batch of query data plus the height of the last block available from the current worker. Take the `header.number` field of the last element of the retrieved JSON array - it is the height you want. Even if your query returns no data, you'll still get the block data for the last block in the range, so this procedure is safe.

6. Set `currentBlock` to the height from the previous step plus one.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 until all the required data is retrieved.
