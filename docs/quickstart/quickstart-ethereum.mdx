# Quickstart: Ethereum

This guide follow through the steps to set up the environment, clone, build and run a template squid for EVM networks. The squid outputs the transactions to the "black hole" address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. It is intended to be a starter project for building a custom squid indexing the EVM log and transaction data on Ethereum and other EVM chains.

## Pre-requisites

Before getting to work on your very first squid, verify that you have installed the following software: 

- Node v16.x
- Docker 
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Please note:
- The squid template is **not** compatible with `yarn`. Use `npm` instead.
- Windows users are recommended to install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

Additional information about development environment setup is available [here](/tutorials/development-environment-set-up).

### Step 1: Clone <span><a href="https://github.com/subsquid/squid-evm-template">squid-evm-template</a></span>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subsquid/squid-evm-template.git
cd squid-evm-template
```

###  Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### Step 3: Build the squid

```bash
make build
```

### Step 4: Launch Postgres and detach

```bash
make up
```


### Step 5: Create the database schema and run the processor

 The squid we have just built ingests pre-indexed data from a Kusama Archive. This data is then transformed, as defined by the data handler in `processor.ts`.
 
 This command will keep the console busy until manually terminated:

```bash
make process
```
