# Quickstart: generate from ABI

The `abi` template generates a ready-to-use squid from an EVM contract ABI. The squid decodes and indexes the EVM logs and transactions of the contract into a local Postgres database. Additionally, it serves the indexed data with a rich GraphQL API supporting pagination and filtering. 

## Pre-requisites

Before getting to work on your very first squid, verify that you have installed the following software: 

- Node v16.x or newer
- [Squid CLI](/squid-cli) v2.1.0 or newer
- Docker

:::info
Earlier versions of the template were based on `Makefile`. The new version uses [`@subsquid/commands` scripts](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-sdk/tree/master/util/commands), defined in `commands.json` which are automatically recognized as `sqd` sub-commands.
:::

Please note:
- The squid template is **not** compatible with `yarn`. Use `npm` instead.

## Step 1: Scaffold from a template 

Come up with a new memorable name for your squid and scaffold from [squid-abi-template](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-abi-template)
using [`sqd init`](/squid-cli/init):

```bash
sqd init my-awesome-squid --template abi
cd my-awesome-squid
# install the dependencies
npm ci
```

##  Step 2: Generate and build the squid

- Consult the [EVM configuration page](/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/configuration) and choose an archive endpoint from the list of supported EVM networks. 
- Prepare the contract ABI and save it into the `assets` folder, e.g. as `assets/abi.json`.

:::info
For public contracts the ABI can be fetched automatically using an Etherscan-like API. To do so simply omit the `--abi` flag. Check out
```sh
sqd generate --help
```
for a full list of supported options.
:::

Generate and build the squid with
```bash
sqd generate \
--address <address> \
--abi assets/abi.json \
--archive <network archive alias or endpoint URL> \
--event '*' \
--function '*' \
--from <starting block>

sqd build
```

### Example

```bash
sqd generate \
--address 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F \
--abi assets/abi.json \
--archive eth-mainnet \
--event '*' \
--function '*' \
--from 1000000

sqd build
```

## Step 3: Launch Postgres in a detached Docker container

```bash
sqd up
```

## Step 4: Generate the schema migrations

```bash
sqd migration:generate
```

## Step 5: Run the squid processor

Run the processor with
```bash
sqd process
```

The squid now ingests the contract transactions and event log data, decodes it and stores it in the database.

## Step 6: Start the GraphQL server

In a separate terminal window, run

```bash
sqd serve
# in another window
sqd open http://localhost:4350/graphql
```

This starts a GraphQL server serving the indexed events and transactions from the local database. The GraphQL playground is available at [`http://localhost:4350/graphql`](http://localhost:4350/graphql). Open it in a browser and run sample queries by applying filters and data selections in the panel to the left.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  events(limit: 10) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Step 7: Customize

[Hack](/develop-a-squid/schema-file) the schema file `schema.graphql` and the [processor](/develop-a-squid/evm-processor) `src/processor.ts` to index the data your way!
