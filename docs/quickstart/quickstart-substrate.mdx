# Quickstart: Substrate chains

This guide follow through the steps to set up the environment, clone, build and run a template squid for substrate networks. The squid indexes transfers on the Kusama network. It is intended to be a stepping stone for building a custom squid for any Substrate-based chain.

## Pre-requisites

Before getting to work on your very first squid, verify that you have installed the following software: 

- Node v16.x
- Docker 
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Please note:
- The squid template is **not** compatible with `yarn`. Use `npm` instead.
- Windows users are recommended to install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

Additional information about development environment setup is available [here](/tutorials/development-environment-set-up).

**Step 1:** Come up with a new memorable name for your squid and scaffold from <span><a href="https://github.com/subsquid/squid-substrate-template">squid-substrate-template</a></span>
using [`sqd init`](/squid-cli/init):

```bash
sqd init my-awesome-squid --template substrate
cd my-awesome-squid
```

###  Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### Step 3: Build the squid

```bash
make build
```

### Step 4: Launch Postgres and detach

```bash
make up
```


### Step 5: Create the database schema and run the processor

 The squid we have just built ingests pre-indexed data from a Kusama Archive. This data is then transformed, as defined by the data handler in `processor.ts`.
 
 This command will keep the console busy until manually terminated:

```bash
make process
```



### Step 6: Start the GraphQL server

This should be run in a separate terminal window:

```bash
make serve
```

The GraphQL playground is available at `http://localhost:4350/graphql`. Open it in a browser and run
sample queries by applying filters and data selections in the panel to the left.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  accountsConnection(orderBy: id_ASC) {
    totalCount
  }
}
```
