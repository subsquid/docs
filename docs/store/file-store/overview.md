# Filesystem store

## Overview

The Squid SDK provides append-only [`Store` interface](/store/store-interface) implementations for saving the data generated by squids to files. The store is primarily designed for offline analytics. It supports CSV and parquet files, persisted either locally or to a s3 storage. See the list of [Packages](#packages) below.

The file-based stores provide the same failover guarantees as Postgres-based stores, as the stores rollbacks to the last successful state after a restart or shutdown. The stores _always_ partition the produced data set along the "block height" dimension, even when the block height is not explicitly defined in the data schema. The number of blocks in a partition varies, as the partition files are written either when the buffer reaches a specified byte size or when the data is old enough. Thus, depending on the use case, one may choose a suitable trade off between the lag of the indexed data and the number of partitioned files produced by the store. See [Filesystem Syncs and Dataset Partitioning](#filesystem-syncs-and-dataset-partitioning) for details and configuration options.

The core component used for storing squid data to files is the `Database` class from `@subsquid/file-store`. Using it is as simple as constructing an instance and passing it to [`processor.run()`](/store/store-interface) as the first argument. This results in `ctx.store` exposing [table writers](#table-writer-interface) that can be used to store rows of data.

#### Example

Save ERC20 `Transfer` events retrieved by [EVM processor](/evm-indexing) in `transfers.csv` files:

```typescript
import {EvmBatchProcessor} from '@subsquid/evm-processor'
import * as erc20abi from './abi/erc20'
import {Database, LocalDest} from '@subsquid/file-store'
import {Column, Table, Types} from '@subsquid/file-store-csv'

const processor = /* processor definition */

const dbOptions = {
  tables: {
    TransfersTable: new Table('transfers.csv', {
      from: Column(Types.String()),
      to: Column(Types.String()),
      value: Column(Types.Numeric())
    })
  },
  dest: new LocalDest('./data'),
  chunkSizeMb: 10
}

processor.run(new Database(dbOptions), async (ctx) => {
  for (let c of ctx.blocks) {
    for (let log of c.logs) {
      if (/* the log item is a Transfer we're interested in */) {
        let { from, to, value } =
          erc20abi.events.Transfer.decode(log)
        ctx.store.TransfersTable.write({
          from,
          to,
          value: value.toBigInt()
        })
      }
    }
  }
})
```
The resulting `./data` folder may look like this:
```bash
./data/
├── 0000000000-0007688959
│   └── transfers.csv
├── 0007688960-0007861589
│   └── transfers.csv
...
├── 0016753040-0016762029
│   └── transfers.csv
└── status.txt
```
Each of the folders here contains a little over 10 MBytes of data. `status.txt` will contain the height of the last indexed block, `16762029` in this case.

## Packages

`@subsquid/file-store` is the core package that contains the implementation of `Database` for filesystems. At least one file format addon must be installed alongside it. Available formats:

* **CSV**: Supported via [`@subsquid/file-store-csv`](../csv-table).
* **Parquet**: An [advanced format](https://parquet.apache.org) that works well for larger data sets. Supported via [`@subsquid/file-store-parquet`](../parquet-table).

Data in either of these formats can be written to

* **A local filesystem**: Supported by `@subsquid/file-store` out of the box.
* **A bucket in an Amazon S3-compatible cloud**: Supported via [`@subsquid/file-store-s3`](../s3-dest).

## `Database` Options

Constructor of the `Database` class from `file-store` accepts a configuration object as its only argument. Its format is as follows:
```typescript
DatabaseOptions {
  tables: Record<string, Table>
  dest: Dest
  chunkSizeMb?: number
  syncIntervalBlocks?: number
  hooks?: DatabaseHooks<Dest>
}
```
Here,
* `Table` is an interface for classes that make [table writers](#table-writer-interface), objects that convert in-memory tabular data into format-specific file contents. An implementation of `Table` is available for every file format supported by `file-store`. Consult [pages about specific output formats](..) to find out how to define `Table`s.
* **`tables`** is a mapping from developer-defined string handles to `Table` instances. A table writer will be created for each `Table` in this mapping. It will be exposed at `ctx.store.<tableHandle>`.
* **`dest`** is an instance of `Dest`, an interface for classes that take the properly formatted file contents and write them onto a particular filesystem. An implementation of `Dest` is available for every filesystem supported by `file-store`. For local filesystems use the `LocalDest` class from the `@subsquid/file-store` package and supply `new LocalDest(outputDirectoryName)` here. For other targets consult [documentation pages specific to your filesystem choice](..).
* **`chunkSizeMb`**, **`syncIntervalBlocks`** and **`hooks`** are optional parameters that tune the behavior of the [dataset partitioning algorithm](#filesystem-syncs-and-dataset-partitioning).

## Table Writer Interface

For each `Table` supplied via the `tables` field of the constructor argument, `Database` adds a table writer property to [`ctx.store`](/store/store-interface). The writer is exposed at `ctx.store.<tableHandle>`, where `<tableHandle>` is the key of the `Table` instance in the `tables` mapping. It has the following methods:

**`ctx.store.<tableHandle>.write(record: T)`**  
**`ctx.store.<tableHandle>.writeMany(records: T[])`**  

Here, `T` is a `Table`-specific data row type. See the [documentation pages on support for specific file formats](..) for details.

These synchronous methods add rows of data to an in-memory buffer and perform no actual filesystem writes. Instead, the write [happens automatically when a new dataset partition is created](#filesystem-syncs-and-dataset-partitioning). The methods return the table writer instance and can be chained.

## Filesystem Syncs and Dataset Partitioning

As the indexing proceeds, the processor continues to append new data to the in-memory buffer of `Database`. At the end of each batch the tool decides whether to write a new dataset partition. A partition is written when either

* the amount of data stored in the buffer exceeds **`chunkSizeMb`** (20 MBytes by default) _across all tables_, or
* **(1)** **`syncIntervalBlocks`** is finite (default - infinite), **(2)** the blockchain head is reached and **(3)** there is at least one row of data in the buffer, or
* **(1)** **`syncIntervalBlocks`** is finite, **(2)** at least **`syncIntervalBlocks`** blocks has been processed since the last write and **(3)** there is at least one row of data in the buffer.

This approach keeps the number of files at a reasonable level while ensuring that the dataset is kept up-to-date, and it does that for both high and low rates of processor data:

* For high, stable data rates (e.g. events from the [USDC contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48)), it suffices to keep `syncIntervalBlocks` at the default value (infinity). Once the processor catches up with the blockchain, it will keep producing partitions of roughly the same size at block intervals much smaller than the blockchain size, thus keeping the dataset updated. The balance between the dataset latency and the number of files is tuned with the `chunkSizeMb` parameter.
* For low data rates (e.g. `LiquidationCall` events from the [AAVE V2 LendingPool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9) - emitted once every few hours) `syncIntervalBlocks` allows to govern the dataset latency directly. Once the processor reaches the blockhain head, it keeps the dataset up to date to within `syncIntervalBlocks` blocks behind the chain. Absence of new partitions beyond that range has a clear interpretation: no new data is available.

:::warning
If `syncIntervalBlocks` is kept at the default value and the data rate is low, the resulting dataset may end up never catching up to the chain in a practical sense. Indeed, in extreme cases the processor _may end up writing no data at all_. For example, all the aforementioned `LiquidationCall` events fit into a CSV file less than 20 Mbytes in size. With the default values of `syncIntervalBlocks` and `chunkSizeMb` the buffer size never reaches the threshold value and no data is written to the filesystem.
:::

By default, `Database` maintains a record of the syncing progress in the `status.txt` file. When the processor with a `Database` instance starts, it calls the `onStateRead()` function that reads the highest reached block from `status.txt` on the target filesystem. If the file does not exist, the function returns -1. The syncing resumes starting at the next block (zeroth or genesis block if `status.txt` does not exist).

Syncing status record is updated every time a new partition is written to the dataset: the processor calls `onFlush()` which overwrites `status.txt` with the new highest reached block.

As a result, the integrity of the data set is guaranteed given the blockchain history up to the point recorded in `status.txt`.

The functions `onStateRead()` and `onStateUpdate()` can be overridden using the **`hooks`** constructor argument field. To do that, set that field to
```typescript
DatabaseHooks<Dest> {
  onStateRead(dest: Dest): Promise<HashAndHeight | undefined>
  onStateUpdate(dest: Dest, info: HashAndHeight): Promise<void>
}
```
Parameters:
* **dest**: the `Dest` object used by `Database`. Use it to access the filesystem.
* **info**: a `{height: number, hash: string}` object.

Overriding these functions can be useful for transferring some processor state between batches reliably. A basic example of using **`hooks`** can be found [here](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-file-store/blob/fcc8a63dc2deb8c3f843aa525f806ff9cdf778fb/test/src/main.ts#L36).
