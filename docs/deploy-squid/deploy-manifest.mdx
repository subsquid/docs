# Deployment manifest

The deployment manifest is named `squid.yaml` by convention. The manifest defines how the squid should be built, customized and scaled during the deployment to Aquarium. It is used together with [`sqd deploy`](/squid-cli/deploy) to deploy or update an existing squid version.

With the introduction of the deployment manifest the addons (`postgres`) and the API services (`api`) become optional. This allows flexible deployment configuration for analytic use-cases (e.g. transform and write to s3 or BigQuery).
 
## Header

The manifest header defines the squid metadata

| Field                    |      Archive endpoint                         |  
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| `manifestVersion`        | Only `subsquid.io/v0.1` is currently supported     |
| `name` | A globally unique squid name. Can only contain lowercase Latin letters (`a-z`) and a dash (`-`). | 
| `version`                 | Squid version. **Must be an integer**. A squid deployment is canonically identified as `${name}@${version}`.  |
| `description`  | (Optional) A short description of the squid  |

## `build:`

Specifies the way the squid is built into a docker image. Only an empty `build:` section is supported, and the squid must adhere
to the default [folder structure](/develop-a-squid/squid-structure).

In particular, the following files and folders **must** be present in the root folder of the squid:

- `/db`
- `/src`
- `/assets` 
- `schema.graphql`
- `tsconfig.json` 
- `package-lock.json`
- `package.json` 

<details><summary>Under the hood, the Aquarium build engine uses the following Docker file.</summary>
<p>

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:16-alpine AS node
FROM node AS node-with-gyp
RUN apk add g++ make python3

FROM node-with-gyp AS builder
WORKDIR /squid
ADD package.json .
ADD package-lock.json .
RUN npm ci
ADD tsconfig.json .
ADD src src
RUN npm run build

FROM node-with-gyp AS deps
WORKDIR /squid
ADD package.json .
ADD package-lock.json .
RUN npm ci --production

FROM node AS squid
WORKDIR /squid
COPY --from=deps /squid/package.json .
COPY --from=deps /squid/package-lock.json .
COPY --from=deps /squid/node_modules node_modules
COPY --from=builder /squid/lib lib
RUN echo -e "loglevel=silent\\nupdate-notifier=false" > /squid/.npmrc
ADD db db
ADD assets assets
ADD schema.graphql .
```

</p>
</details>

All the squid services (`api`, `processor`, `migrate`) use the same container image but with different commands.

## `deploy:`

The `deploy` section may define:

- `addons` Additional services deployed for the squid. 
  + `postgres` Deploys a Postgres 14 instance and injects `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PORT` env. variables to the squid services.
- `secrets` A list of secret names that must be provided by Aquarium. If any of the secrets is not defined, the deployment will fail
- `processor` The processor service of the squid. 
  + `cmd` **Required** The command to be used by the container.
- `api` The API service of the squid.
  + `cmd` **Required** The command to be used by the container. In particular, for the GraphQL API service, provide here additional flags to define [subscriptions](/develop-a-squid/graphql-api/subscriptions) or [caching](/develop-a-squid/graphql-api/caching)
- `migrate`: (Optional) The command to be run on squid init. **If not defined, `migrate` is executed with the default command.**
  + `cmd` (Optional) The command to be executed by the init container. Default: `['npx', 'squid-typorem-migration', 'apply'].


The `processor` and `api` services may additionally define
- `environment` (Optional) A list of environment variables to be set for the container. Useful for e.g. logging
- `env` (Optional) An env file to be added to the list of variables

## `scale:`

The `scale` section allows allocating additional computing resources for the squid addons and services. This option is only available for Premium Aquarium accounts. To apply for a Premium account, fill the [form](https://luvp4va64ru.typeform.com/to/QrRF66q5).

The manifest supports the following scaling options:

### Addons 

Each addon is optional. In particular, the `postgres` addon should be removed if the squid only writes data to external sinks.

For `postgres`:
- `storage`: the size of the allocated disk, in [memory resource units](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory), e.g. `100G`.
- `profile`: `small | medium | large`. Specifies the allocated resources for the pod running the Postgres instance. The default is `small`.

The profile specifications for `postgres` are as follows:
- `small`: `1 vCPU`, `1Gi` RAM
- `medium`: `2 vCPU`, `2Gi` RAM
- `large`: `4 vCPU`, `4Gi` RAM


### Services

The `api` service is optional (e.g. if the squid only writes data to external sinks)

`processor`:
 - `profile`: `small | medium | large`. The machine specification (with extra vCPU and RAM). Default: `small`.

`api`:
 - `profile`: `small | medium | large`. The machine specification (with extra vCPU and RAM). Default: `small`.
 - `replicas`: the number of the API gateway replicas. The traffic is automatically load balanced between the replicas.

Each squid has a canonical (prod) API endpoint exposed `https://squid.subsquid.io/${name}/graphql`, see [promote to production](/deploy-squid/promote-to-production). Each version is independently served at `https://squid.subsquid.io/${name}/v/${version}/graphql`.

The profile specifications for the API server replicas are as follows:
- `small`: `0.5 vCPU`, `256Mi` RAM
- `medium`: `1 vCPU`, `512Gi` RAM
- `large`: `2 vCPU`, `1Gi` RAM


## Examples

A minimal example of manifest is below:

```yaml title="squid.yaml"
manifestVersion: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid
version: 1
description: |-
  My sample squid  

build: 

deploy:
  addons:
    postgres: 
  processor:
    cmd: [ "node", "lib/processor" ] 
  api:
    cmd: [ "npx", "squid-graphql-server"]
```

An extended version:

```yaml title="squid.yaml"
manifestVersion: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid
version: 1
description: |-
  My advanced squid 

build: 

deploy:
  addons:
    postgres: 
  # the set of secrets that must be set and provided by Aquarium
  secrets:
    - ACALA_RPC_ENDPOINT
    - COINGECKO_API_KEY 
  migrate:
    cmd: ["echo", "skip migrations!"]
  processor:
    # additional env variables
    environment:
        SQD_DEBUG=sqd:mapping
    env:
    # env variables from a file
       - .deploy.env  
    cmd: [ "node", "lib/processor" ] 
  api:
    # custom run command for the GraphQL server
    cmd: [ "npx", "squid-graphql-server", "--subscriptions", "--max-root-fields", "10", "--sql-statement-timeout", "1000" ] 

scale:
  addons:
     postgres:
         storage: 100G
         profile: medium
  processor:
     profile: medium
  api:
     profile: large
     # load-balance three replicas
     replicas: 3
```
