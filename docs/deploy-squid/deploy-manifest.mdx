# Deployment manifest

The deployment manifest is named `squid.yaml` by convention and defines how the squid should be deployed to the Aquarium. 

## Header

The manifest header defines the squid metadata

| Field                    |      Archive endpoint                         |  
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| `manifestVersion`        | Only `subsquid.io/v0.1` is currently supported     |
| `name` | A globally unique squid name, used as a prefix for the GraphQL endpoint(s) | 
| `version`                 | Squid version. A squid deployment is canonically identified as `${name}@${version}` |
| `description`  | (Optional) A short description of the squid  |

## `build:`

Specifies the way the squid is built into a docker image. Only an empty `build:` section is supported, and the squid must adhere
to the default [folder structure](/develop-a-squid/squid-structure).

In particular, the following files and folders **must** be present in the root folder of the squid:

- `/db`
- `/lib`
- `/src`
- `/assets` 
- `schema.graphql`
- `tsconfig.json` 
- `package-lock.json`
- `package.json` 

<details><summary>Under the hood, the Aquarium build engine uses the following Docker file.</summary>
<p>

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:16-alpine AS node
FROM node AS node-with-gyp
RUN apk add g++ make python3

FROM node-with-gyp AS builder
WORKDIR /squid
ADD package.json .
ADD package-lock.json .
RUN npm ci
ADD tsconfig.json .
ADD src src
RUN npm run build

FROM node-with-gyp AS deps
WORKDIR /squid
ADD package.json .
ADD package-lock.json .
RUN npm ci --production

FROM node AS squid
WORKDIR /squid
COPY --from=deps /squid/package.json .
COPY --from=deps /squid/package-lock.json .
COPY --from=deps /squid/node_modules node_modules
COPY --from=builder /squid/lib lib
RUN echo -e "loglevel=silent\\nupdate-notifier=false" > /squid/.npmrc
ADD db db
ADD assets assets
ADD schema.graphql .
```

</p>
</details>

## `deploy:`

The `deploy` section may define:


- `addons` Additional services deployed for the squid. 
  + `postgres` Deploys a Postgres 14 instance and injects `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PORT` variables to the rest of the squid services.
- `secrets` A list of secret names that must be provided by Aquarium. If some of those secrets were not defined in advance, the deployment will fail
- `processor` The processor service of the squid. 
  + `cmd` **Required** The command to be used by the container
- `api` The API service of the squid.
  + `cmd` **Required** The command to be used by the container

The `processor` and `api` services may additionally define
- `environment` (Optional) A list of environment variables to be set for the container. Useful for e.g. logging
- `env` (Optional) An env file to be added to the list of variables

## `scale:`

The `scale` section specifies custom deployment options for enterprise squids. This option is only available for paid Aquarium plans.

One can additionally specify:

For the `postgres` addon:
- The `storage` size

For `processor`:
- The machine specification (with extra vCPU and RAM)

For `api`:
- The machine specification (with extra vCPU and RAM)
- The number of replicas. The traffic is automatically load balanced between the replicas.

## Examples

A minimal example of manifest is below:

```yaml title="squid.yaml"
manifestVersion: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid
version: 1
description: |-
  My sample squid  

build: 

deploy:
  addons:
    postgres: 
  processor:
    cmd: [ "node", "lib/processor" ] 
  api:
    cmd: [ "npx", "squid-graphql-server"]
```

An extended version:

```yaml title="squid.yaml"
manifestVersion: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid
version: 1
description: |-
  My advanced squid 

build: 

deploy:
  addons:
    postgres: 
         # additional configs for addons
         version: 14
  # the set of secrets that must be set and provided by Aquarium
  secrets:
    - ACALA_RPC_ENDPOINT
    - COINGECKO_API_KEY 
  processor:
    # additional env variables
    environment:
        SQD_DEBUG=sqd:mapping
    env:
    # env variables from a file
       - .deploy.env  
    cmd: [ "node", "lib/processor" ] 
  api:
    # custom run command for the GraphQL server
    cmd: [ "npx", "squid-graphql-server", "--subscriptions", "--max-root-fields", "10", "--sql-statement-timeout", "1000" ] 

scale:
  addons:
     postgres:
         storage: 100G
  processor:
     profile: p1.medium
  api:
     profile: a1.large
     # load-balance three replicas
     replicas: 3
```
