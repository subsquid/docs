# Monitoring and sync status

The Subsquid SDK offers a useful command line tool to monitor the Cloud-deployed Squid. the `npx squid logs` subcommand will output the logs of a Squid, when providing its name and version.

The optional arguments `-f` and `-l <n>` will, respectively, make sure that the stream of logs is continuously updated and that the last `n` lines are shown, before outputting any new ones.

Let's take the example of our `SquidSaas` squid and fetch logs for its version labeled `1`:

```
â‡’   sqd squid logs SquidSaas@1 -f -l 10
