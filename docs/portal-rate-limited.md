# You've been rate limited

If you are seeing this page, chances are that your squids used SQD's public portal and got rate limited. This happens when you make more than 50 requests in any 10 seconds long interval.

Here are your options:

1. [Set up a private SQD Network portal](/subsquid-network/participate/portal) with or without the support for real time data (see below).

2. Migrate to [SQD Cloud](/cloud) where we'll manage the portal for you.

3. Do nothing and accept the reduced sync rate.
