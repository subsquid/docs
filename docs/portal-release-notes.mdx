# **Introducing SQD Portal**

After five months of rigorous load testing and countless iterations, we’re thrilled to announce the **first phase** of the **Portal** rollout, our decentralized, streaming-based data retrieval solution.

### What is the SQD Portal?

Portal reimagines blockchain data access, leaving behind the limitations of centralized RPC nodes. It’s faster, smarter, and fully decentralized—how data retrieval was always meant to be.

### Key Differences

**Before Portal**

- **Optimized but centralized**: Data hosted on 32 large workers managed by Subsquid Labs.
- **Limited replication**: Minimal redundancy, increasing the risk of failures.

**With Portal**

- **Fully decentralized**: 1,400+ worker nodes power the SQD Mainnet independently.
- **30x replication on average**: Data is redundantly stored across the network for maximum reliability.
- **Faster than ever**: The query engine, previously written in Python, has been fully rewritten in Rust. It now leverages parallelized queries and incorporates numerous query execution performance optimizations, delivering an overall **10-50x performance boost** compared to the centralized Archives.

### What’s in It for You?

- **Portal is Live**: Lock SQD tokens, run your own Portal, and take full control of your data pipeline.
- **Selective Cloud Migration**: Available by invite-only, but you can [request early access here](https://app.deform.cc/form/e2a440fd-b892-4c8a-a56a-4e5c7b503257).
- **Decentralized data made simple**: Benefit from 30x replication and enhanced resilience.
- **Unrivaled performance**: Handle even the heaviest workloads with lightning-fast ingestion rates, capable of querying up to **20 million blocks per second**.

### Why Portal?

Built for your needs:

- **Speed**: Optimized for even the most demanding workloads.
- **Simplicity**: Easy for newcomers, powerful for experts, with seamless migration from centralized Archives.
- **Control**: Run your own Portal for full autonomy.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Token-gated, anonymous access with complete control over your endpoints.

### How To Get Started

Whether you want to explore, migrate, or self-host, we’ve made it simple:

1. **Explore**: Join our beta program to access the Public Portal for 100+ EVM networks—[apply here](https://app.deform.cc/form/e2a440fd-b892-4c8a-a56a-4e5c7b503257).
2. **Migrate**: SQD Cloud Migration is **invite-only**—our team will reach out if you’re eligible. Want to migrate your Squids today? Reach out to us [here](https://app.deform.cc/form/e2a440fd-b892-4c8a-a56a-4e5c7b503257) to fast-track your migration.
3. **Self-Host**: Want full autonomy? [Request access through the form](https://app.deform.cc/form/e2a440fd-b892-4c8a-a56a-4e5c7b503257), and we’ll provide all the resources you need to set up your own Portal.

### What’s Next?

- **December 2024**: Beta Portal launch.
- **January 2025**: Public Portal release and the debut of “Hot Blocks” for real-time, decentralized streaming.
- **Roadmap Update**: A detailed roadmap will be published very soon.

### FAQs

**Q: I’m used to querying via gateways. Will this disrupt my workflow?**

Not at all. Your experience will remain seamless—just faster, smoother, and decentralized.

**Q: Are there any limitations?**

None. Everything you use today, plus added speed, reliability, and autonomy.

**Q:** **What Happens to Archives?**

Archives remain live until **May 2025**, with seamless migration guides to help you switch. Retiring centralized archives ensures alignment with our vision of full decentralization.

**Q: Why should I switch to Portal?**

- Faster queries with multi-node parallelism.
- Simple gateway updates for effortless adoption.
- Full autonomy through self-hosting.


We’re excited to help you get started.
