# Indexing Hyperliquid with SQD

## Overview

SQD is a decentralized hyper-scalable data platform optimized for providing efficient, permissionless access to large volumes of data. It currently serves historical on-chain data, including event logs, transaction receipts, traces, and per-transaction state diffs. SQD offers a powerful toolkit for creating custom data extraction and processing pipelines, achieving an indexing speed of up to 150k blocks per second.

SQD has been supporting Hyperliquid as one of the few providers since the very beginning. We currently support:
- HyperEVM Testnet 
- HyperEVM Mainnet
- HyperCore L1 Mainnet - coming soon
