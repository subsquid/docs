  Subscribe to txn data with addTransaction()

# EVM transactions 

**Disclaimer: This page has been (re)written for ArrowSquid, but it is still work in progress. It may contain broken links and memos left by the documentation developers.**

:::warning
Processor data subscription methods guarantee that all data mathing their filters will be retrieved, but for technical reasons non-matching data may be added to the [batch context iterables](/arrowsquid/evm-indexing/context-interfaces/#blockdata). As such, it is important to always filter the data within the batch handler.
:::

**`addTransaction(options)`**: Subscribe to transactions data. The `options` object has the following structure:
```typescript
{
  // filters
  from?: string[]
  to?: string[]
  sighash?: string[]
  range?: {from: number, to?: number}

  // related data retrieval
  logs?: boolean
  stateDiffs?: boolean
  traces?: boolean
}
```
[//]: # (!!!! re-check the interface upon the release)

The filters here are
+ `from` and `to`: the sets of addresses of tx senders and receivers. Omit it or set to `undefined` to subscribe to transactions from/to any address.
+ `sighash`: [first four bytes](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/#the-data-field) of the Keccak hash (SHA3) of the canonical representation of the function signature. Omit it or set to `undefined` to subscribe to any transaction.
+ `range`: the range of blocks where the transactions should be looked for.

Enabling the `stateDiffs`, `traces` and/or `logs` flags will cause the processor to retrieve [state diffs](/arrowsquid/evm-indexing/configuration/state-diffs/), [traces](/arrowsquid/evm-indexing/configuration/traces/) and/or event logs that occured as a result of each selected transaction. The data will be added to the appropriate iterables within the [block data](/arrowsquid/evm-indexing/context-interfaces/#blockdata).

Note that transactions can also be requested by [`addLog()`](../evm-logs), [`addStateDiff()`](../state-diffs) and [`addTrace()`](../traces) as related data.

[//]: # (!!!! check in the final version whether it also adds the data to the items)

Selection of the exact data to be retrieved for each transaction and the optional related data items is done with the `setFields()` method documented on the [Data selection](../data-selection) page. Some examples are available below.

:::info
Typescript ABI modules generated by [`squid-evm-typegen`](/evm-indexing/squid-evm-typegen) provide function sighashes as constants, e.g.

```ts
  import * as erc20abi from './abi/erc20'
  // ...
    sighash: [erc20abi.functions.transfer.sighash],
  // ...
```

## Examples

1) Request all EVM calls to the contract `0x6a2d262D56735DbA19Dd70682B39F6bE9a931D98`:
```ts
processor.addTransaction({to: ['0x6a2d262d56735dba19dd70682b39f6be9a931d98']})
```

2) Request all transactions matching sighash of `transfer(address,uint256)`:
```ts
processor.addTransaction({sighash: ['0xa9059cbb']})
```

3) Request all `transfer(address,uint256)` calls to the specified addresses, from block `6_000_000` onwards and fetch their inputs. Also retrieve all logs emitted by these calls.
```ts
processor
  .addTransaction({
    to: [
      '0x6a2d262d56735dba19dd70682b39f6be9a931d98',
      '0x3795c36e7d12a8c252a20c5a7b455f7c57b60283'
    ],
    sighash: [
      '0xa9059cbb'
    ],
    range: {
      from: 6_000_000
    },
    logs: true
  })
  .setFields({
    transaction: {
      input: true
    }
  })
```

4) Mine all transactions to and from Vitalik Buterin's address [`vitalik.eth`](https://etherscan.io/address/vitalik.eth). Fetch the involved addresses, ETH value and hash for each transaction. Get traces with the [default fields](../../context-interfaces/#trace) for outgoing transactions.

[//]: # (!!!! replace the archive URL once archive-registry carries Arrowsquid archives)
[//]: # (???? which traces are these - "execution" or "debug"?)

```ts
const VITALIK_ETH = '0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045'.toLowerCase()

const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    archive: 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet',
    chain: 'https://eth-rpc.gateway.pokt.network'
  })
  .setFinalityConfirmation(75)
  .addTransaction({
    to: [VITALIK_ETH]
  })
  .addTransaction({
    from: [VITALIK_ETH],
    traces: true
  })
  .setFields({
    transaction: {
      from: true,
      to: true,
      value: true,
      hash: true
    }
  })

processor.run(new TypeormDatabase(), async (ctx) => {
  for (let c of ctx.blocks) {
    for (let txn of c.transactions) {
      if (txn.to === VITALIK_ETH || txn.from === VITALIK_ETH) {
        // just output the tx data to console
        ctx.log.info(txn, 'Tx:')
      }
    }
  }
})
```
