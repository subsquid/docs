  Subscribe to event data with addLog()

# EVM logs

:::warning
Processor data subscription methods guarantee that all data matching their data requests will be retrieved, but for technical reasons non-matching data may be added to the [batch context iterables](/evm-indexing/context-interfaces). As such, it is important to always filter the data within the batch handler.
:::

#### `addLog(options)` {#add-log}

Get event logs emitted by some _or all_ contracts in the network. `options` has the following structure:
```typescript
{
  // data requests
  address?: string[]
  topic0?: string[]
  topic1?: string[]
  topic2?: string[]
  topic3?: string[]
  range?: {from: number, to?: number}

  // related data retrieval
  transaction?: boolean
}
```
Data requests:
+ `address`: the set of addresses of contracts emitting the logs. Omit to subscribe to events from all contracts in the network.
+ `topicN`: the set of values of topicN.
+ `range`: the range of blocks to consider.

With `transaction = true` the processor will retrieve all parent transactions and add them to the `transactions` iterable within the [block data](/evm-indexing/context-interfaces). Additionally it will expose them via the `.transaction` field of each log item.

Note that logs can also be requested by the [`addTransaction()`](../transactions) method as related data.

Selection of the exact data to be retrieved for each log and its optional parent transaction is done with the `setFields()` method documented on the [Data selection](../data-selection) page. Some examples are available below.

## Examples

Fetch `NewGravatar(uint256,address,string,string)` and `UpdateGravatar(uint256,address,string,string)` event logs emitted by `0x2E645469f354BB4F5c8a05B3b30A929361cf77eC`. For each log, fetch topic set, log data. Fetch parent transactions with their inputs.

```ts
const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    archive: lookupArchive('eth-mainnet'),
    chain: 'https://eth-rpc.gateway.pokt.network'
  })
  .setFinalityConfirmation(75)
  .addLog({
    address: ['0x2e645469f354bb4f5c8a05b3b30a929361cf77ec'],
    topic0: [
      // topic: 'NewGravatar(uint256,address,string,string)'
      '0x9ab3aefb2ba6dc12910ac1bce4692cf5c3c0d06cff16327c64a3ef78228b130b',
      // topic: 'UpdatedGravatar(uint256,address,string,string)'
      '0x76571b7a897a1509c641587568218a290018fbdc8b9a724f17b77ff0eec22c0c',
    ],
    transaction: true
  })
  .setFields({
    log: {
      topics: true,
      data: true
    },
    transaction: {
      input: true
    }
  })
```

:::info
Typescript ABI modules generated by [`squid-evm-typegen`](/evm-indexing/squid-evm-typegen) provide event signatures/topic0 values as constants, e.g.

```ts
  import * as gravatarAbi from './abi/gravatar'
  // ...
    topic0: [
      gravatarAbi.events.NewGravatar.topic,
      gravatarAbi.events.UpdatedGravatar.topic,
    ],
  // ...
```
