  Retrieve execution traces with addTrace()

# Traces

:::warning
Processor data subscription methods guarantee that all data matching their data requests will be retrieved, but for technical reasons non-matching data may be added to the [batch context iterables](/evm-indexing/context-interfaces). As such, it is important to always filter the data within the batch handler.
:::

#### `addTrace(options)` {#add-trace}

Subscribe to [call execution traces](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/debug-tracecall). This allows for tracking internal calls. The `options` object has the following structure:
```typescript
{
  // data requests
  callTo?: string[]
  callSighash?: string[]
  createFrom?: string[]
  rewardAuthor?: string[]
  suicideRefundAddress?: string[]
  type?: string[]
  range?: {from: number, to?: number}

  // related data retrieval
  transaction?: boolean
  subtraces?: boolean
}
```
The data requests here are:
+ `type`: get traces of types from this set. Allowed types are `'create' | 'call' | 'suicide' | 'reward'`.
+ `callTo`: get `call` traces *to* the addresses in this set.
+ `callSighash`: get `call` traces with signature hashes in this set.
+ `createFrom`: get `create` traces *from* the addresses in this set.
+ `rewardAuthor`: get `reward` traces where block authors are in this set.
+ `suicideRefundAddress`: get `suicide` traces where refund addresses in this set.
+ `range`: get traces from transactions from this range of blocks.

[//]: # (!!!! Update when the data requests set stabilizes)

Enabling the  `transaction` flag will cause the processor to retrieve transactions that the traces belong to. Enabling `subtraces` will cause the processor to retrieve the downstream traces in addition to those that matched the data requests. These extra data items will be added to the appropriate iterables within the [block data](/evm-indexing/context-interfaces).

Note that traces can also be requested by the [`addTransaction()`](../transactions) method as related data.

[//]: # (???? Check whether the final version adds the transactions / subtraces to the items, too)

Selection of the exact data to be retrieved for each trace item is done with the `setFields()` method documented on the [Data selection](../data-selection) page. Be aware that field selectors for traces do not share their names with the fields of trace data items, unlike field selectors for other data item types. This is due to traces varying their structure depending on the value of the `type` field.

### Exploring internal calls of a given transaction

For a [`mint` call to Uniswap V3 Positions NFT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf178718219151463aa773deaf7d9367b8408e35a624550af975e089ca6e015ca).

```ts
import {EvmBatchProcessor} from '@subsquid/evm-processor'
import {TypeormDatabase} from '@subsquid/typeorm-store'

const TARGET_TRANSACTION = '0xf178718219151463aa773deaf7d9367b8408e35a624550af975e089ca6e015ca'
const TO_CONTRACT = '0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88' // Uniswap v3 Positions NFT
const METHOD_SIGHASH = '0x88316456' // mint

const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    archive: 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet',
    chain: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth'
  })
  .setFinalityConfirmation(75)
  .setBlockRange({ from: 16962349, to: 16962349 })
  .addTransaction({
    to: [TO_CONTRACT],
    sighash: [METHOD_SIGHASH],
    traces: true
  })
  .setFields({ trace: { callTo: true } })

processor.run(new TypeormDatabase(), async ctx => {
  let involvedContracts = new Set<string>()
  let traceCount = 0

  for (let block of ctx.blocks) {
    for (let trc of block.traces) {
      if (trc.type === 'call' && trc.transaction?.hash === TARGET_TRANSACTION) {
        involvedContracts.add(trc.action.to)
        traceCount += 1
      }
    }
  }

  console.log(`txn ${TARGET_TRANSACTION} had ${traceCount-1} internal transactions`)
  console.log(`${involvedContracts.size} contracts were involved in txn ${TARGET_TRANSACTION}:`)
  involvedContracts.forEach(c => { console.log(c) })
})
```
