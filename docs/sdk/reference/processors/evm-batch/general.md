# General settings

:::tip
The method documentation is also available inline and can be accessed via suggestions in most IDEs.
:::

The following setters configure the global settings of `EvmBatchProcessor`. They return the modified instance and can be chained.

Certain configuration methods are required:

 * one or both of [`setGateway()`](#set-gateway) and [`setRpcEndpoint()`](#set-rpc-endpoint)
 * [`setFinalityConfirmation()`](#set-finality-confirmation) whenever [RPC ingestion](/sdk/resources/unfinalized-blocks) is enabled, namely when
   - a RPC endpoint was configured with [`setRpcEndpoint()`](#set-rpc-endpoint)
   - RPC ingestion has **NOT** been explicitly disabled by calling [`setRpcDataIngestionSettings({ disabled: true })`](#set-rpc-data-ingestion-settings)

Here's how to choose the data sources depending on your use case:

 * If you need real-time data and your network [has a Subsquid Network gateway](/subsquid-network/reference/evm-networks), use both [`setGateway()`](#set-gateway) and [`setRpcEndpoint()`](#set-rpc-endpoint). The processor will obtain as much data as is currently available from the network, then switch to ingesting recent data from the RPC endpoint.
 * If you can tolerate your data being several thousands of blocks behind the chain head, you do not want to use a RPC endpoint and your network [has a Subsquid Network gateway](/subsquid-network/reference/evm-networks), use [`setGateway()`](#set-gateway) only.
 * If your EVM network does not have a Subsquid Network gateway, use [`setRpcEndpoint()`](#set-rpc-endpoint) only. You can use this regime to [work with local development nodes](/sdk/tutorials/evm-local).
 * If your squid uses [direct RPC queries](/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/state-queries/?typegen=evm) then [`setRpcEndpoint()`](#set-rpc-endpoint) is a hard requirement. You can reduce the RPC usage by adding a Network data source with [`setGateway()`](#set-gateway). Further, if you can tolerate a latency of a few thousands of blocks, you can disable RPC ingestion with [`setRpcDataIngestionSettings({ disabled: true })`](#set-rpc-data-ingestion-settings). In this scenario RPC will only be used for the queries you explicitly make in your code.

### `setGateway(url: string | GatewaySettings)` {#set-gateway}

Adds a [Subsquid Network](/subsquid-network) data source. The argument is either a string URL of a Subsquid Network gateway or
```ts
{
  url: string // gateway URL
  requestTimeout?: number // in milliseconds
}
```
See [EVM gateways](/subsquid-network/reference/evm-networks).

### `setRpcEndpoint(rpc: ChainRpc)` {#set-rpc-endpoint}

Adds a RPC data source. If added, it will be used for
 - [RPC ingestion](/sdk/resources/unfinalized-blocks) (unless explicitly disabled with [`setRpcDataIngestionSettings()`](#set-rpc-data-ingestion-settings))
 - any [direct RPC queries](/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/state-queries/?typegen=evm) you make in your squid code

A node RPC endpoint can be specified as a string URL or as an object:
```ts
type ChainRpc = string | {
  url: string // http, https, ws and wss are supported
  capacity?: number // num of concurrent connections, default 10
  maxBatchCallSize?: number // default 100
  rateLimit?: number // requests per second, default is no limit
  requestTimeout?: number // in milliseconds, default 30_000
  headers: Record<string, string> // http headers
}
```
Setting `maxBatchCallSize` to `1` disables batching completely.

:::tip
We recommend using private endpoints for better performance and stability of your squids. For Subsquid Cloud deployments you can use the [RPC addon](/cloud/resources/rpc-proxy). If you use an external private RPC, keep the endpoint URL in a [Cloud secret](/cloud/resources/env-variables#secrets).

### `setDataSource(ds: {archive?: string, chain?: ChainRpc})` (deprecated) {#set-data-source}

Replaced by [`setGateway()`](#set-gateway) and [`setRpcEndpoint()`](#set-rpc-endpoint).

### `setRpcDataIngestionSetting(settings: RpcDataIngestionSettings)` {#set-rpc-data-ingestion-settings}

Specify the [RPC ingestion](/sdk/resources/unfinalized-blocks) settings.
```ts
type RpcDataIngestionSettings = {
  disabled?: boolean
  preferTraceApi?: boolean
  useDebugApiForStateDiffs?: boolean
  debugTraceTimeout?: string
  headPollInterval?: number
  newHeadTimeout?: number
}
```
Here,
 * `disabled`: Explicitly disables data ingestion from an RPC endpoint.
 * `preferTraceApi`: By default, [`debug_traceBlockByHash`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug#debugtraceblockbyhash) is used to obtain [call traces](../traces). This flag instructs the processor to utilize [`trace_` methods](https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module) instead. This setting is only effective for finalized blocks.
 * `useDebugApiForStateDiffs`: By default, [`trace_replayBlockTransactions`](https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module#trace_replayblocktransactions) is used to obtain [state diffs](../state-diffs) for finalized blocks. This flag instructs the processor to utilize [`debug_traceBlockByHash`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug#debugtraceblockbyhash) instead. This setting is only effective for finalized blocks. **WARNING:** this will significantly increase the amount of data retrieved from the RPC endpoint. Expect download rates in the megabytes per second range.
 * `debugTraceTimeout`: If set, the processor will pass the `timeout` parameter to [debug trace config](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug#traceconfig).
 * `headPollInterval`: Poll interval for new blocks in milliseconds. Poll mechanism is used to get new blocks via HTTP connections. Default: 5000.
 * `newHeadTimeout`: When ingesting from a websocket, this setting specifies the timeout in milliseconds after which the connection will be reset and subscription re-initiated if no new blocks were received. Default: no timeout.

### `setFinalityConfirmation(nBlocks: number)` {#set-finality-confirmation}

Sets the number of blocks after which the processor will consider the consensus data final. Use a value appropriate for your network. For example, for Ethereum mainnet a widely cited value is 15 minutes/75 blocks.

### `setBlockRange({from: number, to?: number})` {#set-block-range}

Limits the range of blocks to be processed. When the upper bound is specified, processor will terminate with exit code 0 once it reaches it.

Note that block ranges can also be specified separately for each data request. This method sets global bounds for all block ranges in the configuration.

### `includeAllBlocks(range?: {from: number, to?: number})` {#include-all-blocks}

By default, processor will fetch only blocks which contain requested items. This method modifies such behavior to fetch all chain blocks. Optionally a range of blocks can be specified for which the setting should be effective.

### `setPrometheusPort(port: string | number)` {#set-prometheus-port}

Sets the port for a built-in prometheus health metrics server (serving at `http://localhost:${port}/metrics`). By default, the value of PROMETHEUS_PORT environment variable is used. When it is not set, processor will pick an ephemeral port.
